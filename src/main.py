Tommy's review
Done: At start where is told me to pick a stat to increase, change Stat to Ability Score for consistent terminology
Done: An explanation of why that increase is happening would be nice
Done: When selecting what skills to be trained in, a notification of how many skills I can be trained in would be nice.
   Later GUI option, boxes to select which to be trained in
/help options to know what syntax is expected would be helpful
