  "trait": [
   "Dwarf",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Dwarves have a well-earned reputation as a stoic and stern people, ensconced within citadels and cities carved from solid rock. While some see them as dour and humorless crafters of stone and metal, dwarves and those who have spent time among them understand their unbridled zeal for their work, caring far more about quality than quantity. To a stranger, they can seem untrusting and clannish, but to their friends and family, they are warm and caring, their halls filled with the sounds of laughter and hammers hitting anvils.\nDwarves are slow to trust those outside their kin, but this wariness is not without reason. Dwarves have a long history of forced exile from ancestral holds and struggles against the depredations of savage foes, especially giants, goblinoids, orcs, and the horrors that dwell deep below the surface. While trust from a dwarf is hard-won, once gained it is as strong as iron.\n If you want to play a character who is as hard as nails, a stubborn and unrelenting adventurer, with a mix of rugged toughness and deep wisdom-or at least dogged conviction-you should play a dwarf.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Strive to uphold your personal honor, no matter the situation. \n\t- Appreciate quality craftsmanship in all forms and insist upon it for all your gear. \n\t- Don't waver or back down once you've set your mind to something.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- See you as stubborn, though whether they see this as an asset or a detriment changes from one person to the next. \n\t- Assume you are an expert in matters related to stonework, mining, precious metals, and gems. \n\t- Recognize the deep connection you have with your family, heritage, and friends.\nHeading:Physical Description\nDwarves are short and stocky, standing about a foot shorter than most humans. They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of masculinity and honor among the dwarves, and thus a clean-shaven male dwarf is considered weak, untrustworthy, or worse.\n Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming of age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can live to around 350 years old.\nHeading:Society\nThe ancient surface empire the dwarves once ruled fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies. Today's dwarves today retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends.\n While the distance between their mountain Sky Citadels can create vast cultural divides between various dwarf clans, most dwarven societies share a number of similarities. Nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and gem-cutting. Most are highly skilled at architecture and mining, and many share a hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids.\n Few dwarves are seen without their clan dagger strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a dwarf's birth and bears the gemstone of their clan. A parent uses this dagger to cut the infant's umbilical cord, making it the first weapon to taste their blood.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nDwarves tend to value honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. They have a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often very particular about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harder- especially when strong ale is involved.\n The typical dwarf is lawful good or lawful neutral and prefers to worship deities of those alignments. Torag, god of dwarvenkind, is the dwarves' primary deity, though worship of Torag's family members is also common.\nHeading:Adventurers\nDwarven adventurers tend to work as treasure hunters or sellswords. They often leave their citadels and subterranean cities in search of wealth to enrich their homeland or to reclaim long-lost dwarven treasures or lands taken by the enemies of their kin.\n Typical dwarven backgrounds include acolyte, artisan, merchant, miner, and warrior. Dwarves excel at many of the martial classes, such as barbarian, fighter, monk, and ranger, but they also make excellent clerics and druids.\nHeading:Names\nDwarves honor their children with names taken from ancestors or dwarven heroes, and it's quite rare to invent a new name or to borrow a name from another culture for a child. When introducing themselves, dwarves tend to list their family and clan, plus any number of other familial connections and honorifics. Dwarven names usually contain hard consonants and are rarely more or fewer than two syllables.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAgna, Bodill, Dolgrin, Edrukk, Grunyar, Ingra, Kazmuk, Kotri, Lupp, Morgrym, Rogar, Rusilka, Torra, Yangrit\n",

  "trait": [

  "description": "As an ancient people, elves have seen great change and have the perspective that can come only from watching the arc of history. After leaving the world in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most notably from terrible demons that have invaded parts of their lands. To some, the elves are objects of awe-graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among themselves, however, the elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on living up to these ideals.\nElves combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Valuing kindness and beauty, elves ever strive to improve their manners, appearance, and culture.\n Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They're slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, but for a specific reason: they subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions. There's a physical element to this attunement, but it isn't only superficial. Elves who spend their lives among shorter-lived peoples often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die. These elves are called the Forlorn.\n If you want a character who is magical, mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Carefully curate your relationships with people with shorter lifespans, either keeping a careful emotional distance or resigning yourself to outliving them. \n\t- Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them. \n\t- Have features such as eye color, skin tone, hair, or mannerisms that reflect the environment in which you live.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Focus on your appearance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile. \n\t- Assume you practice archery, cast spells, fight demons, and have perfected one or more fine arts. \n\t- Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.\nHeading:Physical Description\nWhile generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, featuring large and vibrant-colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.\n Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who's lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elven fashion, like the elves themselves, tends to reflect their surroundings. Elves living in the forests and other wilderness locales wear clothing that plays off the terrain and flora of their homes, while those who live in cities tend to wear the latest fashions.\n Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren't considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century, once they've experienced more, held several occupations, and outlived a generation of shorter-lived people. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.\nHeading:Society\nElven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline. Their society peaked millennia ago, long before they fled the world to escape a great calamity. They've since returned, but rebuilding is no easy task. Their inborn patience and intellectual curiosity make elves excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge. Elven architecture displays their deep appreciation of beauty, and elven cities are wondrous works of art.\n Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which the elves call ilduliel, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nElves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. As such, many are chaotic good. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry. Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.\nHeading:Adventurers\nMany elves adventure to find beauty and discover new things. Typical backgrounds for an elf include emissary, hunter, noble, scholar, or scout. Elves often become rangers or rogues, taking advantage of their dexterity, or alchemists or wizards, exploring their intellectual curiosity.\nHeading:Names\nAn elf keeps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf's life or even on a whim. A single elf might be known by many names by associates of different ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically-at least in the Elven tongue. They so commonly end in \u201c-el\u201d or \u201c-ara\u201d that other cultures sometimes avoid names ending in these syllables to avoid sounding too elven.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal, Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon\n",

  "trait": [
   "Gnome",
   "Humanoid"

  "description": "Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey. While it's unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, this lineage manifests in modern gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete. These qualities are further reflected in their physical characteristics, such as spindly limbs, brightly colored hair, and childlike and extremely expressive facial features that further reflect their otherworldly origins.\nAlways hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction-the Bleaching-strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences, in the gnomes' absence of crucial magical essence from the First World. Gnomes latch onto a source of localized magic where they live, typically primal magic, as befits their fey lineage, but this isn't enough to avoid the Bleaching unless they supplement this magic with new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color-literally-from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.\n If you want a character with boundless enthusiasm and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should play a gnome.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Embrace learning and hop from one area of study to another without warning. \n\t- Rush into action before fully taking stock of the entire situation. \n\t- Speak, think, and move quickly, and lose patience with those who can't keep up.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Appreciate your enthusiasm and the energy with which you approach new situations. \n\t- Struggle to understand your motivations or adapt to your rapid changes of direction. \n\t- See you as unpredictable, flighty, unreliable, or even reckless.\nHeading:Physical Description\nMost gnomes stand just over 3 feet in height and weigh little more than a human child. They exhibit a wide range of natural skin, hair, and eye colors. For gnomes that haven't begun the Bleaching, nearly any hair and eye color other than white is possible, with vibrant colors most frequent, while skin tones span a slightly narrower spectrum and tend toward earthy tones and pinkish hues, though occasionally green, black, or pale blue. Gnomes' large eyes and dense facial muscles allow them to be particularly expressive in their emotions. Gnomes typically reach physical maturity at the age of 18, though many gnomes maintain a childlike curiosity about the world even into adulthood. A gnome can theoretically live to any age if she can stave off the Bleaching indefinitely, but in practice gnomes rarely live longer than around 400 years.\nHeading:Society\nWhile most gnomes adopt some of the cultural practices of the region in which they live, they tend to pick and choose, adjusting their communities to fit their own fey logic. This often leads to majority gnome communities eventually consisting almost entirely of gnomes, as other people, bewildered by gnomish political decisions, choose to move elsewhere. Gnomes have little culture that they would consider entirely their own. No gnome kingdoms or nations exist on the surface of Golarion, and gnomes wouldn't know what to do with such a state if they had one.\n By necessity, few gnomes marry for life, instead allowing relationships to run their course before amicably moving on, the better to stave off the Bleaching with new experiences. Though gnome families tend to be small, many gnome communities raise children communally, with fluid family boundaries. As adults depart the settlement, unrelated adolescents sometimes tag along, creating adopted families to journey together.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nThough gnomes are impulsive tricksters with inscrutable motives and confusing methods, many at least attempt to make the world a better place. They are prone to fits of powerful emotion, and they are often good but rarely lawful. Gnomes most commonly worship deities that value individuality and nature, such as Cayden Cailean, Desna, Gozreh, and Shelyn.\nHeading:Adventurers\nAdventure is not so much a choice as a necessity for most gnomes. Adventuring gnomes often claim mementos, allowing them to remember and relive their most exciting stories.\n Gnomes often consider the entertainer, merchant, or nomad backgrounds. In addition, the animal whisperer, barkeep, gambler, and tinker backgrounds are particularly appropriate.\n Gnomes' connection to magic makes spellcasting classes particularly thematic for you, especially classes that match the tradition of your primal innate spells, such as druid or primal sorcerer, though wellspring gnomes might choose others.\nHeading:Names\nGnome names can get quite complex and polysyllabic. They have little interest in familial names, and most children receive their names purely on a parent's whim. Gnomes rarely concern themselves with how easy their names are to pronounce, and they often go by shorter nicknames. Some even collect and chronicle these nicknames. Among gnomes, the shorter the name, the more feminine it's considered to be.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAbroshtor, Bastargre, Besh, Fijit, Halungalom, Krolmnite, Neji, Majet, Pai, Poshment, Queck, Trig, Zarzuket, Zatqualmie\n",

  "description": "The convoluted histories other people cling to don't interest goblins. These small folk live in the moment, and they prefer tall tales over factual records. The wars of a few decades ago might as well be from the ancient past. Misunderstood by other people, goblins are happy how they are. Goblin virtues are about being present, creative, and honest. They strive to lead fulfilled lives, rather than worrying about how their journeys will end. To tell stories, not nitpick the facts. To be small, but dream big.\nGoblins have a reputation as simple creatures who love songs, fire, and eating disgusting things and who hate reading, dogs, and horses-and there are a great many for whom this description fits perfectly. However, great changes have come to goblinkind, and more and more goblins resist conformity to these stereotypes. Even among goblins that are more worldly, many still exemplify their old ways in some small manner, just to a more sensible degree. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others' stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions' trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.\n Though goblins' culture has splintered radically, their reputation has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and many work twice as hard at proving their worth.\n If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic, and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Strive to prove that you have a place among other civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself. \n\t- Fight tooth and nail-sometimes literally-to protect yourself and your friends from danger. \n\t- Lighten the heavy emotional burdens others carry (and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Work to ensure you don't accidentally (or intentionally) set too many things on fire. \n\t- Assume you can't-or won't-read. \n\t- Wonder how you survive given your ancestry's typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior, and love of fire.\nHeading:Physical Description\nGoblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.\n Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.\nHeading:Society\nGoblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order-a notoriously difficult task. As new threats rise across the Inner Sea region, many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that offer their people a greater chance at survival. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.\n Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as \u201clongshanks,\u201d won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. However, their attitude as a people is changing rapidly, and their short lifespans and poor memories help them adapt quickly.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nEven well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning they're rarely lawful. Most goblin adventurers are chaotic neutral or chaotic good. Organized worship confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating. Longshanks might have books upon books about the structures of divinity, but to a goblin, anything can be a god if you want it to. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though, and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.\nHeading:Adventurers\nTo some degree, almost every goblin is an adventurer, surviving life on the edge using skill and wits. Goblins explore and hunt for treasures by nature, though some become true adventurers in their own rights, often after being separated from their group or tribe.\n Goblins often have the acrobat, criminal, entertainer, gladiator, hunter, and street urchin backgrounds. Consider playing an alchemist, since many goblins love fire, or a bard, since many goblins love songs. As scrappy survivors, goblins are often rogues who dart about the shadows, though their inherently charismatic nature also draws them to the pursuit of magical classes such as sorcerer.\nHeading:Names\nGoblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier. Since there aren't any real traditions regarding naming in goblin culture, children often name themselves once they're old enough to do something resembling talking.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAk, Bokker, Frum, Guzmuk, Krobby, Loohi, Mazmord, Neeka, Omgot, Ranzak, Rickle, Tup, Wakla, Yonk, Zibini\n",

  "description": "Claiming no place as their own, halflings control few settlements larger than villages. Instead, they frequently live among humans within the walls of larger cities, carving out small communities alongside taller folk. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadows of their larger neighbors, while others prefer a nomadic existence, traveling the world and taking advantage of opportunities and adventures as they come.\nOptimistic and cheerful, blessed with uncanny luck, and driven by powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easygoing, they are the best kind of opportunists, and their passions favor joy over violence. Even in the jaws of danger, halflings rarely lose their sense of humor.\n Many taller people dismiss halflings due to their size or, worse, treat them like children. Halflings use these prejudices and misconceptions to their advantage, gaining access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring mischief or heroism. A halfling's curiosity is tempered by wisdom and caution, leading to calculated risks and narrow escapes.\n While their wanderlust and curiosity sometimes drive them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties to house and home, often spending above their means to achieve comfort in their homelife.\n If you want to play a character who must contend with these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort, you should play a halfling.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Get along well with a wide variety of people and enjoy meeting new friends. \n\t- Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiosity, even when you know it's going to lead to trouble. \n\t- Hold a deep and personal hatred of the practice of slavery and devote yourself to freeing those who still labor against their will.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Appreciate your ability to always find a silver lining or something to laugh about, no matter how dire the situation. \n\t- Think you bring good luck with you. \n\t- Underestimate your strength, endurance, and fighting prowess.\nHeading:Physical Description\nHalflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.\n Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.\n Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.\nHeading:Society\nDespite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don't usually tend to congregate. They have no cultural homeland in the Inner Sea region, and they instead weave themselves throughout the societies of the world. Halflings eke out whatever living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service jobs. Some halflings reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.\n Wherever halflings go, they seamlessly blend into the society they find themselves in, adapting to the culture of the predominant ancestry around them and adding their uniquely halfling twists, creating a blend of cultural diffusion that enriches both cultures.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nHalflings are loyal to their friends and their family, but they aren't afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive. Halfling alignments vary, typically closely in keeping with the alignment of the other ancestries that live around them. Halflings favor gods that either grant luck, like Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber, and many appreciate Cayden Cailean's role as a liberator, as well as any religions common among other ancestries around them.\nHeading:Adventurers\nHalflings' natural wanderlust and opportunistic nature make them ideal adventurers. Many people put up with their vivacious attitudes in return for the natural talents they provide and the popular superstition that traveling with a halfling is good luck.\n Typical backgrounds for halflings include acrobat, criminal, emissary, entertainer, laborer, and street urchin. Halflings make great clerics and rogues, but many also become monks or rangers.\nHeading:Names\nHalfling names are usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids hard consonants. Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long or complex names as a sign of arrogance. This goes only for their own people, however-halflings have names that suit them, and they understand that elves and humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics. Humans in particular have a tendency to refer to halflings by nicknames, with \u201cLucky\u201d being common to the point of absurdity.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAnafa, Antal, Bellis, Boram, Etune, Filiu, Jamir, Kaleb, Linna, Marra, Miro, Rillka, Sistra, Sumak, Yamyra\n",

  "description": "As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.\nHumans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors-for no better reason than because they can.\n If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause. \n\t- Seek to understand your purpose in the world. \n\t- Cherish your relationships with family and friends.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and-in most cases- your open-mindedness. \n\t- Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth. \n\t- Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.\nHeading:Physical Description\nHumans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.\n Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.\nHeading:Society\nHuman variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nHumanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.\nHeading:Names\nUnlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.\nHeading:Sample Names\nA variety of human ethnic groups-many of which have origins on distant lands- populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.\n Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.\n",

  "description": "A half-elf is born to an elf and a human, or to two half-elves. The life of a half-elf can be difficult, often marked by a struggle to fit in. Half-elves don't have their own homeland on Golarion, nor are populations of half-elves particularly tied to one another, since they often have very disparate human and elven traditions. Instead, most half-elves attempt to find acceptance in either human or elven settlements.\n Half-elves often appear primarily human, with subtly pointed ears and a taller stature than most full-blooded humans. Half-elves lack the almost alien eyes of their elf parents, though they do have a natural presence-and often a striking beauty- that leads many to become artists or entertainers. Despite this innate appeal, many half-elves have difficulty forming lasting bonds with either humans or elves due to the distance they feel from both peoples as a whole.\n Half-elves live longer than other humans, often reaching an age around 150 years. This causes some of them to fear friendship and romance with humans, knowing that they'll likely outlive their companions.\nYou can create a half-elf character by selecting the half-elf heritage at 1st level. This gives you access to elf and half-elf ancestry feats in addition to human ancestry feats.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Keep to yourself and find it difficult to form close bonds with others. \n\t- Strongly embrace or reject one side or the other of your parentage. \n\t- Identify strongly with and relate to other people with mixed ancestries.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Find you more attractive than humans and more approachable than elves. \n\t- Dismiss your human ethnicity and culture in light of your elven heritage. \n\t- Downplay the challenges of being caught between two cultures.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Other Halves\nBy default, half-elves and half-orcs descend from humans, but your GM might allow you to be the offspring of an elf, orc, or different ancestry. In these cases, the GM will let you select the half-elf or half-orc heritage as the heritage for this other ancestry. The most likely other parent of a half-elf are gnomes and halflings, and the most likely parents of a half-orc are goblins, halflings, and dwarves.\nSee Human heritages.\n"

  "source": "Core Rulebook pg. 55 4.0",
  "description": "A half-orc is the offspring of a human and an orc, or of two half-orcs. Because some intolerant people see orcs as more akin to monsters than people, they sometimes hate and fear half-orcs simply due to their lineage. This commonly pushes half-orcs to the margins of society, where some find work in manual labor or as mercenaries, and others fall into crime or cruelty. Many who can't stand the indignities heaped on them in human society find a home among their orc kin or trek into the wilderness to live in peace, apart from society's judgment.\n Humans often assume half-orcs are unintelligent or uncivilized, and half-orcs rarely find acceptance among societies with many such folk. To an orc tribe, a half-orc is considered smart enough to make a good war leader but weaker physically than other orcs. Many half-orcs thus end up having low status among orc tribes unless they can prove their strength.\n A half-orc has a shorter lifespan than other humans, living to be roughly 70 years old.\nYou can create a half-orc character by selecting the half-orc heritage at 1st level. This gives you access to orc and half-orc ancestry feats in addition to human ancestry feats.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Ignore, embrace, or actively counter the common stereotypes about half-orcs. \n\t- Make the most of your size and strength, either physically or socially. \n\t- Keep your distance from people of most other ancestries, in case they unfairly reject you due to your orc ancestors.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you enjoy and excel at fighting but aren't inclined toward magical or intellectual pursuits. \n\t- Pity you for the tragic circumstances they assume were involved in your birth. \n\t- Get out of your way and back down rather than face your anger.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Other Halves\nBy default, half-elves and half-orcs descend from humans, but your GM might allow you to be the offspring of an elf, orc, or different ancestry. In these cases, the GM will let you select the half-elf or half-orc heritage as the heritage for this other ancestry.

 "Hobgoblin": {

  "trait": [
   "Goblin",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Taller and stronger than their goblin kin, hobgoblins are equals in strength and size to humans, with broad shoulders and long, powerful arms.\nThe reputation of hobgoblins in the Inner Sea region has been upended by Oprak, the hobgoblin nation established recently in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas. The Ironfang Legion that stormed through Molthune and Nirmathas only a few years ago made a calculated decision to cease fighting, claim Oprak as a new homeland, and seek peace with its neighbors. Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, the hobgoblins of Oprak have begun to cautiously investigate Avistan in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those that suffered terrible cruelties under the Ironfang Legion, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold soldiers might prove to be allies against the endless hordes of the Whispering Tyrant.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Seek out the most effective and practical solutions to any problem. \n\t- Encourage a clear chain of command among any group you travel with, following orders even if you disagree with them. \n\t- Look for opportune alliances with other creatures, even if you don't fully understand or trust them.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Consider you dangerous, due to your reputation and intimidating appearance. \n\t- Assume you hate magic and other mystical arts. \n\t- Recognize your incredible endurance, dedication, and discipline.\nHeading:Physical Description\nHobgoblins stand nearly as tall as humans, though they tend to have shorter legs and longer arms and torsos. They have the bald, wide heads and beady eyes, and gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned. Hobgoblins are remarkably hardy; they recover from illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long periods of time with little difficulty.\n Hobgoblins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk, and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old, reaching adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood around 14. Hobgoblins typically live up to 70 years of age.\nHeading:Society\nHobgoblins structure their society after military hierarchies. Even civilian groups such as farming collectives or trading houses organize into regiments, companies, and divisions. Most hobgoblins fixate on social status, and many constantly strive to advance their social position. Hobgoblin punishments are primarily social demotions, although execution or slavery are common for serious crimes, such as arson or desertion.\n Hobgoblin veterans hold a high place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors. Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most hobgoblins don't trust it over the strength of their own sword arms. Their arts tend to have a military bent; many hobgoblins consider stirring marches and weaponsmithing the only artistic endeavors worth pursuing, though Oprak's enforced era of peace is beginning to change this.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nThough familiar with the chaos of war, most hobgoblins have orderly minds and prefer to live within established hierarchies. While many hobgoblins consider sentimentality weak, those with mild temperaments have recently found success in diplomacy and international outreach. As a result, hobgoblin adventurers are usually lawful neutral, with only those rejecting or raised outside of their militaristic society chaotic. Faith has little place in hobgoblin society, as many feel it is impractical, though religious hobgoblins can gain a begrudging modicum of acceptance due to their useful healing magic.\nHeading:Adventurers\nHobgoblin society's rigid militaristic hierarchy produces excellent adventurers, as hobgoblins reach adulthood trained for combat. Due to their upbringing, many hobgoblins have the warrior background. The laborer, martial disciple, miner, and scout backgrounds are also common. Hobgoblins raised away from their people often have the criminal, hermit, or nomad backgrounds instead. Hobgoblins are most often fighters, rangers, or rogues, although hobgoblin rogues approach their class with a disciplined mindset. Hobgoblins hold an ancestral grudge against elves and a distrust of arcane magic, which they call \u201celf magic.\u201d Hobgoblin practitioners of arcane magic are exceedingly rare and usually shunned by other hobgoblins. Particularly clever hobgoblins usually become alchemists.\nHeading:Names\nLike goblins, hobgoblin names tend to be simple, though hobgoblin names usually sound more guttural and forceful. On rare occasions, hobgoblins will alter their names, keeping the core but adding aspects, usually in response to an extreme trauma or a life-altering event. Hobgoblins have no surnames, considering them both pointless and presumptuous; an individual's merits and demerits are to be earned by their actions, not by an association with a particular lineage.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAze, Druknar, Ghargam, Hathkren, Imakra, Kralaeng, Mazkol, Olzu, Rezal, Sivkrag, Volmak, Zornum\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Cantorian Spring\nIn days long past, Cantorys, goddess of life, transformations, and forests, created a staff called the Cantorian Spring and placed it on Golarion for fledgling mortals to find. A powerful devil named Canzoriant learned of the staff and slew Cantorys, claiming it for himself. Using the Cantorian Spring's power, Canzoriant transformed early goblins into the more powerful and calculating hobgoblins, instilling in them a deep hatred for elves. After a failed attempt by elves to claim the staff, the Cantorian Spring disappeared and hasn't been seen since.\nHeading:International Relationships\nOprak holds a powerful magical tool that has contributed to its economic boom: the Onyx Key. Through this powerful artifact, the nation creates planar tunnels that facilitate easy, seamless travel across Golarion. Using the artifact, General Azaersi contacted her fellow hobgoblin nations of Kaoling and, later, Rakh Lo, establishing trade agreements between the three powers. These pacts have faced their share of difficulties, however. Oprak and Rakh Lo quickly grew into close allies, but Kaoling's harsh traditionalism, even among hobgoblins, has complicated diplomatic progress.\nHeading:Looming Concerns\nTo many, the specter of Oprak looms large over the Eye of Dread region. While the Whispering Tyrant is a more fearsome figure, nearby nations worry that once he is defeated, Oprak will be the next monstrous powerhouse on their doorstep. Some nations, like Druma, realize the potential of Oprak as an economic ally. Others, like Molthune and Nirmathas, still feel the sting of the Ironfang Invasion and hold unchecked grudges. Nidal has reached out to extend their non-aggression agreement, and Nirmathas appears grudgingly set to follow suit. Molthune remains undecided, or at least unspoken about its leanings, though rumors suggest that hostility between Oprak and Molthune is rising behind the scenes.\n",

  "description": "PFS Note As of the start of Pathfinder Society Year 3 (August 2021), all characters have access to the leshy ancestry without requiring a boon.\nGuardians and emissaries of the environment, leshies are immortal spirits of nature temporarily granted a physical form.\nLeshies are \u201cborn\u201d when a skilled druid or other master of primal magic conducts a ritual to create a suitable vessel, and then a spirit chooses that vessel to be their temporary home. Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, and so they do not depend upon these druids for care, though it is not uncommon for leshies to maintain lifelong bonds with their creators.\n Not all leshies have a strong enough spirit to strike off completely on their own, however. Weaker nature spirits can form only tenuous bonds that are just strong enough to animate Tiny bodies. These spirits become leshy familiars, acting as companions to their druid creators. Independent leshies are often protective of such leshy familiars, advocating for them to be treated with dignity and respect.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Act as a traveling agent for natural guardians who are unable to leave their territories. \n\t- Encourage civilizations you encounter to cooperate with nature and build their cities in ecologically friendly ways. \n\t- Become attached to new friends you make on your journeys.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Think of you as a curiosity due to your spiritual origins. \n\t- Judge you by your looks, treating you sweetly if you are cute or reacting with horror if you are frightening. \n\t- Assume you know only about nature and are unfamiliar with civilization and society.\nHeading:Physical Description\nLeshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Due to the nature of the ritual used to create a leshy, leshies begin their lives as adults. As spirits, they do not age, and a leshy could potentially remain in the same vessel forever-though leshies rarely consider this outcome to be desirable.\nHeading:Society\nThough guardian leshies often congregate, traveling leshies are not naturally drawn to others of their own kind. To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. A betrayed leshy might not directly attack those who slight them, but they might withdraw support at a critical moment or leave their betrayers to get lost in the wilderness.\n Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though those familiar with leshies know that this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies often take pride in their own appearances and appreciate beauty of all kinds in others, but they rarely form judgments based on physical appearance. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Leshies tend to gravitate toward plant bodies that match their genders. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nA leshy can be of any alignment, depending on what spirit inhabits their body, but their outlook often includes a neutral element. Religion is not particularly significant to most leshies. Those with a philosophical bent lean toward the Green Faith, and Gozreh is the most popular deity among faithful leshies. Some leshies also venerate green men, powerful spirits of nature that act as regional guardians.\nHeading:Adventurers\nSome backgrounds are particularly suitable for adventuring leshies, especially those backgrounds with a tie to the natural world, such as hunter, nomad, or scout. Nature-themed classes such as druid and ranger are popular choices for leshies. As druids, leshies gravitate toward the leaf order. Bard is also a good fit for leshies with a love of storytelling; such leshies often inhabit vine leshy bodies.\nHeading:Names\nLeshies choose and change their names multiple times throughout their lives. These names often represent a facet of their personalities or values, though another common naming convention is to use descriptions of a natural feature they admire. Some leshies even use a cycle of names that changes to align with natural phenomena, such as names based upon the season or the time of day.\nHeading:Sample Names\nScarlet in Summer, Verdant Taleweaver, Lurking Hunter, Masterful Sun Drinker, Noon Sky Evening Song, Snowy Pine Branch, Cascading Rapids\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Green Men\nThe first beings to create leshys were green men, sometimes referred to as leshy kings. These legendary guardians emerge when countless spirits of nature merge and rise to divinity. Many green men discovered how to draw upon the connection they held with other spirits of nature, coaxing them into physical forms. These early leshys worked alongside green men to defend their verdant homes. Though modern leshys have far more varied motivations, many still respect and revere the gods that first gave them a chance at mortal life.\n While green men were indifferent to most non-plant creatures, they didn't scorn the assistance of druids. In time, some green men taught trusted allies a version of the ritual to create leshys.\nHeading:Leshy Resurrection\nLeshys who lose their physical form incorporate the changes they experienced in life into their spirit. Even though a leshy's spirit isn't the same as the soul of many ancestries, resurrection magic can still restore it to their most recent body. Should the ritual fail, it's usually because a leshy has shed too many of their memories and attachments, rather than due to Pharasma's judgment.\nHeading:Life without Form\nLeshy spirits are beings of pure vital essence without any of the otherworldly quintessence known as spiritual essence. Existing without physical form allows them closer contact with memories from their distant past, but this broader perspective gradually erodes memories of their experiences in their most recent body.\n",

 "Lizardfolk": {
  "source": "Character Guide pg. 57 2.0",
  "trait": [
   "Humanoid",
   "Lizardfolk"
  ],
  "description": "Lizardfolk are consummate survivors, heirs to empires considered ancient even by the elves.\nLizardfolk move through the societies of other humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators. They have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding rangers and unsentimental fighters. Though lizardfolk have adapted to many different environments, many of them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As a result, lizardfolk usually prefer equipment that is not easily damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Demonstrate extreme patience, even when pressured to act. \n\t- Hold your people's history in high regard and look to the past for solutions to present problems. \n\t- Strive to adapt perfectly to your environment while also keeping your culture and traditions intact.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you are beholden to tradition and have ancient knowledge. \n\t- See you as cold-blooded and callous due to your subdued physical reactions. \n\t- Respect your impressive strength and your knowledge of natural areas.\nHeading:Physical Description\nLizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but share toothy snouts and long and powerful tails. Those from temperate or desert regions tend toward gray, green, or brown scales that aid in camouflage, while those from tropical climes are brightly colored. Many sport dorsal spikes or garish neck frills that hint at their clan lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15 and live up to 120 years. The average lizardfolk stands 6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime, gaining strength and size with age.\nHeading:Society\nKnown among themselves as iruxi, lizardfolk are raised communally from the moment they break from their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching back thousands of years, brought to life through epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites performed among fields of fossilized bone. Lizardfolk are passionate astrologers with one eye on the future. If they seem slow to act, it is because their long history has taught them the value of patience.\n The simple villages most outsiders associate with iruxi are the homes of migrants in outlying regions. True iruxi settlements are often overlooked, as they are partially or mostly submerged in water. These glass and stone complexes bear the mark of every generation of lizardfolk that lived within them, and lizardfolk bones often adorn the walls, as many lizardfolk believe these remains can be animated by ancestral spirits when the residents are in danger.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMost iruxi are unconcerned with heavy questions of morality and are therefore usually neutral in alignment. Adventuring iruxi who leave their people to travel might have any number of reasons for doing so and can be of any alignment. Iruxi religion plays a large role in their culture, but it is heavily practical, blending animism and ancestor worship with druidic rites. Of the gods, only Gozreh is commonly revered, but lizardfolk may call upon other powers devoted to ancient wyrms, astrology, nature, rivers, and might of arms, from kindly Desna to cruel Hanspur and certain demon lords.\nHeading:Adventurers\nSome background options are particularly suitable for lizardfolk. Wilderness or martial backgrounds like the animal whisperer, hunter, scout, or warrior are ideal. Living at the margins of human civilization means an iruxi might have grown up as a hardy street urchin, traveled as a nomad or sailor, or found work as a laborer or gladiator. Lizardfolk's ties to the wilderness make them excellent rangers or druids. Their outstanding strength serves them well if they select the barbarian, fighter, or monk classes, though they can also strike from stealth as a rogue. Iruxi also have a strong oral tradition kept alive by lizardfolk bards and sorcerers.\nHeading:Names\nLizardfolk names come from their ancient language and tend to be traditional. Names are typically chosen by the clan's astrologer in accordance to omens and which star signs are ascendant when an iruxi egg hatches, though occasionally an iruxi's parents may name a hatchling for an ancestor or a beloved historical hero.\nHeading:Sample Names\nArasheg, Barashk, Essaru, Enshuk, Gishkim, Hazi, Inishish, Kutak, Nasha, Shulkuru, Tizkar, Utakish, Zelkekek\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Droon\nLong before the birth of Azlant, iruxi realms girdled Golarion. Today, only one nation recalls the splendor of that bygone era: Droon, a vast empire on the coast of southern Garund. Here, lizardfolk rule astride dinosaurs. Iruxi nobles settle feuds via ceratosaur duels. Sauropod caravan trains haul goods across seemingly impossible distances. Wizards breed spell-laced rhamphorhynchus familiars, and no thief worth their salt pulls a job without a whistling velociraptor lookout.\nHeading:Iruxi\nWhile most lizardfolk permit humans and others to refer to them by that moniker, they call themselves iruxi. This ancient word arose from the Draconic tongue, though its exact etymology is unclear. In Droon, iruxi astronomers point to the jagged constellation of the Maw and the starry figure who stands against it. Today, while this constellation is called the Lone Mother and features in fables about environmental conservation, she once had another name in dragon lore: Erux, meaning \u201cdefiance.\u201d\nHeading:Iruxi Ancestors\nAncestor worship is central to iruxi spiritual life. Lizardfolk keep their elders' physical remains close, incorporating them into the architecture of their settlements. The bones of deceased iruxi shore up protective walls and fill great vaulting ossuaries. Preserved and suffused with ritual veneration, these bones become magical reservoirs of power. It's rumored that in times of great need, iruxi ancestors will reanimate their bones and fight for their descendants.\n",

  "trait": [
   "Humanoid",
   "Shoony"
  ],
  "description": "Diminutive humanoids who resemble squat, bipedal dogs, shoonies are sometimes mistaken for weak and insular pacifists. However, their sheer perseverance, incredible work ethic, and resourceful use of diplomacy make shoonies far from helpless.\nAccording to shoonies, Aroden created their kind to provide him with pleasant company soon after he created the Isle of Kortos. Shoony culture is rooted in this myth and its implications, which help to explain the ancestry's long reputation for hospitality, good will, and pacifism. War is antithetical to the shoony way of life; shoonies rely on cooperation and persistence to make their way through a world that can seem at times hellbent on destroying them. Shoonies are unflappable in their optimism and always see the best in others, even when faced with frequent subjugation and exploitation that might create bitterness or xenophobia among other societies. To shoonies, peace is a goal always worth striving for, and no villain is beyond redemption, so they aim to resolve problems with peaceful solutions.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Fight to protect those you care about and strive to do the right thing. \n\t- Work hard for long hours in a focused pursuit of distant goals. \n\t- Provide comfort, necessities such as food, and a sense of kinship to those in distress.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Involuntarily fawn over (or recoil from) your physical appearance. \n\t- Protect you from scary situations or terrifying phenomena, out of either friendship or overprotectiveness. \n\t- Appreciate your pragmatism and natural ability to care for others.\nHeading:Physical Description\nShoonies are squat, furry humanoids with flattened canid faces and wet, black eyes. Their fur can be a variety of hues and patterns, with the most common colors being fawn or black, and their loose skin gives even the fittest shoony a pudgy appearance. Shoonies have short, curly tails that sometimes wag involuntarily when the shoony is content or particularly excited or pleased. Like canines, shoonies cannot sweat; they pant to mitigate heat and exertion, and it is not uncommon to see a shoony with a perpetually lolling tongue.\n A shoony reaches maturity after just 8 to 10 years, and the elders of their villages rarely reach the age of 50. Little differentiates male and female shoonies except during the late stages of pregnancy, and as they age, both sexes develop graying facial fur, wrinkled skin, and frail joints. The average shoony is 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.\nHeading:Society\nDespite the shoony drive toward communal living, most shoony settlements are farming villages with populations of no more than a hundred. Shoonies work hard to make their lands bountiful and recognize that large, dense populations can negatively affect the ecosystem. Monster attacks, natural disasters, and exploitation from stronger cultures have all also limited the spread of shoonies across the Inner Sea region.\n Despite their short lifespans, shoonies are happy-go-lucky people with an irrepressible love for the land and their fellow shoonies, and remain optimistic even under the worst circumstances. The simple pleasures of living on this beautiful world, engaging in hard work, and surrounding themselves with loved ones motivate shoonies to push through the hardships that all too often befall their people.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMost shoony societies encourage empathy and loyalty, so they're rarely evil, but they're also practical, traditional, and timid. Most shoony adventurers are neutral good or lawful good. Religion is a cornerstone of shoony village life; shoonies primarily worshipped Aroden until his apparent death. In his absence, many shoonies have adopted Erastil as their patron deity because his emphasis on family, community, and living off the land naturally meshes with typical shoony values. Noble shoonies- especially warriors-sometimes look to Iomedae as an exemplar of integrity, hard work, and sacrifice.\nHeading:Adventurers\nFew shoonies willingly choose to leave their homeland and friends in favor of facing the unknown, and the circumstances that lead a shoony to adventure are often dramatic and life-altering, if not tragic. That said, some shoonies do travel the world in search of riches to bring back to their village or to avenge their kinfolk, and shoony adventurers who show bravery or ingenuity are sure to earn a place in the legends of their people.\n Typical shoonies have the acolyte, farmhand, hunter, laborer, or warrior backgrounds from the Core Rulebook, or the animal wrangler or rigger backgrounds from the Extinction Curse Player's Guide. Many shoony adventurers are fighters who hone their skills to become stalwart defenders of their friends. Some shoonies pursue religious study and become clerics or champions, while others develop their foraging and hunting skills as talented druids and rangers.\nHeading:Names\nWith their strong family values and emphasis on found friends, it's no wonder that shoonies take particular pride in naming their children after other loved ones. Shoony names are short, guttural, and often sound like loose strings of unassociated vowels and soft consonants to people of other ancestries. Shoonies value names and take great care to learn and speak the correct pronunciations of their friends' names.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAhogo, Arnbin, Bighmor, Bondin, Domwurd, Ebmeur, Gopor, Gurna, Hiemgur, Mufurlo, Oriog, Pulumar, Raliamar, Ruggion, Uhulrig, Ungrin.\n",

   "Catfolk",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Curious and gregarious wanderers, catfolk combine features of felines and humanoids in both appearance and temperament. They enjoy learning new things, collecting new tales and trinkets, and ensuring their loved ones are safe and happy. Catfolk view themselves as chosen guardians of natural places in the world and are often recklessly brave, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.\nCatfolk are outgoing, active humanoids who delight in discovery, whether of hidden ruins or a comfortable place to nap. They are exceptionally social, both within their tight-knit communities and with other creatures they meet. Remarkably brave, catfolk see themselves as guardians of the world against forces that would assail it, and they believe that strong communities, breadth of experience, and continual self-improvement aid them in this fight.\n Catfolk have fast reflexes and are even able to twist themselves in the air while falling to land on their feet. As quick as these reflexes are, catfolk have quicker tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry.\n If you want a character who is curious, brave, friendly, and nimble in body and mind, you should play a catfolk.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Demonstrate genuine interest by asking a lot of enthusiastic questions. \n\t- Avoid interpersonal conflict by giving someone a cold shoulder or by simply leaving the area. \n\t- Carefully scout a target or problem before striking at it quickly.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Think you monopolize conversations with your incessant queries or opinions. \n\t- Consider you haughty or prideful. \n\t- Ascribe more emotion than you feel to your involuntary purrs or growling.\nHeading:Physical Description\nAlthough all catfolk walk upright and have soft fur, a long tail, large ears, and vertical pupils, they show at least as much variety as ordinary felines. Catfolk have nimble fingers with short claws that are usually retractable. Most catfolk take great pride in maintaining their appearance and rarely suffer the indignity of being wet or dirty if they can avoid it.\n Catfolk mature quickly and are able to walk at only a few months old, but they otherwise start their careers at roughly the same age as humans do and live to be 60 or 70 years of age. Catfolk are rarely taller than the average human and, because of their lean builds, almost never weigh as much as a human of similar height.\nHeading:Society\nCatfolk call themselves amurruns, although many consider this name to be private. They raise their children in large extended families, where they are given what many other humanoids see as a distressing latitude to explore and get into trouble from a remarkably young age. Catfolk learn a trade in a loose apprenticeship, and the majority learn several trades over their lives.\n Catfolk societies are often led by an appointed leader who speaks on behalf of the community and mediates disputes. A catfolk leader is most often a spellcaster and usually female. Catfolk prefer to deal with grievances by making an elaborate showing of disinterest, or even leaving a community for a time so the problem can die away or work itself out.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nCatfolk aren't a particularly religious people, but most do believe they were uplifted from great primeval cats to confront the evil abominations despoiling natural places and laboring to unmake reality. The gods blessed catfolk with language, the use of tools and weapons, and a strong sense of community.\n Most catfolk are good. They enjoy the freedom to travel and like to set their own paths in life, so more catfolk are chaotic than lawful. Religious catfolk most often practice a nebulous form of animism, appeasing the spirits of the land and the creatures they hunt to preserve the natural order.\nHeading:Adventurers\nCatfolk delight in venturing into unexplored areas, whether untrammeled wildernesses or ancient dungeons. They like finding treasures and baubles, but for most catfolk, the experience of the journey itself is the true reward.\n Typical catfolk backgrounds include acrobat, artist, gambler, hunter, nomad, and scout from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, courier, insurgent, outrider, and root worker from this book. Catfolk's inherent curiosity and agility mean they excel as swashbucklers, bards, fighters, and rogues. Their love of the natural world and drive to puzzle out secrets of all types leads many to become investigators, druids, or sorcerers.\nHeading:Names\nCatfolk are given short names in their youth. Adolescent catfolk are free to choose a different name when they first leave home, though some simply keep the name they've gotten used to. Catfolk love to add titles and honorifics to their names. Some catfolk use their titles exclusively among non-catfolk, and so become known by epithets like Six Fates, Fiend Killer, or Mistcloak.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAlyara, Crinto, Drewan, Espes, Ferrus, Gerran, Halhat, Hoya, Ruun, Sevastin, Tespa, Yonsol, Zakkar, Zathra\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Catfolk Luck\nCatfolk are known for their luck, which they traditionally draw from spirits of creation that they've pleased or emulated. Many catfolk tend to experience this luck as an insistent urge that feels like a warning from a benevolent presence they can't perceive. Others experience it as a reflexive awareness of danger beyond their normal senses. More spiritual catfolk try to tune into the warnings from the spirits of fortune through an art known as serendipity reading.\nHeading:Murraseth\nMurraseth is the largest of several remote catfolk-majority city-states in central Garund. Even distant catfolk take pride in its guilds and its Houses of Names-labyrinthine, live-in galleries for artists and performers who retell catfolk discoveries and tales. Many catfolk consider visiting a House of Names an important life milestone.\n Guilds dominate Murraseth. Perhaps the most distinctive of these groups is the Circle of Lifeshapers, comprised of polymorph specialists and healers.\nHeading:Other Catfolk\nNumerous catfolk ethnicities exist beyond the Inner Sea. The black-spotted Guarrxil of southern Arcadia are renowned for their principled mercenary companies and heroic rangers. The mysterious Caimurru of the western Arcadian coast trade more with First World caravans than with other mortals. The Lyashtaki catfolk of the Valashmai Jungle sometimes make treks far from the jungle via coast-hopping boats.\n",

  "trait": [
   "Humanoid",
   "Kobold"
  ],
  "description": "PFS Note Due to years of successful Pathfinder Society activities, all characters have access to the kobold ancestry.\nEvery kobold knows that their slight frame belies true, mighty draconic power. They are ingenious crafters and devoted allies within their warrens, but those who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers, especially when they have the backing of a draconic sorcerer or true dragon overlord. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.\nKobolds are resourceful survivors whose snare-guarded warrens and opportunistic scavenging have cast them as villains to most other humanoids, with their draconic reverence lending them a reputation as mere minions and nuisances. Yet some kobolds have emerged from their secluded warrens seeking the relative safety of surface settlements, the lucrative prospects of the adventuring life, or validating awe from followers of their own.\n If you want a character with oversized confidence, deadly cunning, and the ancient power of dragons flowing through their veins, you should play a kobold.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons. \n\t- Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes. \n\t- Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger. \n\t- Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses. \n\t- Consider your claims of draconic power to be overblown, delusional, or endearing.\nHeading:Physical Description\nKobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, or-more rarely-vestigial wings or draconic breath. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60.\n The color of a kobold's scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community's draconic exemplar, whether that's the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they're descended.\nHeading:Society\nKobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable patron (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). They often achieve an unshakable fervor and loyalty to their new cause or leader. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.\n Whether led by a dragon or not, kobolds almost always identify themselves with a type of dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar's personality.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nAll but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.\n Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar's order or Shelyn's artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also common subjects of worship. Kobolds also often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.\nHeading:Adventurers\nKobolds often adventure in pursuit of the power, lore, and treasure that they feel befit their disproportionately large egos. When adventurers, militias, or careless tyrants shatter a kobold community, the survivors often latch onto new families, seeking emotional solace-and sometimes revenge. Typical kobold backgrounds include artisan, artist, criminal, hunter, miner, scout, and tinker from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, cultist, scavenger, and servant from this book. Kobolds excel as bards, rangers, rogues, and sorcerers, though they also often channel their ingenuity as alchemists or wizards.\nHeading:Names\nA young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAzrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Kobold Origins\nKobolds in the Inner Sea region have numerous origin stories, many tied to the conflict between the dragon gods Dahak and Apsu. Kobolds who live in caves near the surface often believe they predate true dragons, as Dahak scooped up their ancestors and transformed them into dragons. The further a kobold settlement is from a cave system, the less these tales link kobolds directly to dragons. Kobolds in swamps generally tell of their birth from blood that Dahak shed in battle, while those who dwell in trees and mountains often believe they were born of Dahak's tears.\nHeading:Other Kobolds\nKobolds most commonly share the coloration and some physical resemblance to chromatic and metallic dragons, but others closely match different sets of true dragons-notably esoteric, imperial, planar, and primal dragons. In Tian Xia, kobolds with an imperial dragon appearance are nearly as common as those with chromatic and metallic features, and often take roles as advisors and spellcasters. Planar and primal kobolds sometimes hatch when a settlement is in great danger or exposed to planar energies, and are often considered to be destined for greatness. Esoteric kobolds are rare anywhere, though they appear more regularly in places with strange energies (such as the Impossible Lands), and are often feared and mistrusted by their clutchmates.\nHeading:Traps!\nKobolds are renowned trap-makers and take great pride in their ability to design, develop, and construct cunning and complex varieties of these hidden defensive mechanisms, which they call \u201cslow fangs.\u201d They often test new trap concepts far from their homes, using them to hunt or harass disliked neighbors. This allows kobolds to iterate on designs, sometimes mixing traps to see if they're more effective in tandem rather than alone. Only once a trap idea has proven effective is it considered worthy to defend a kobold settlement.\n Trap-makers are treated by most kobold settlements as intellectual elites, and are often given the kind of deference other cultures reserve for priests and war heroes. A kobold tribe lacking a trap-maker is likely to send an emissary to find one and implore them to come teach their craft.\n",

   "Orc"
  ],
  "description": "Orcs are forged in the fires of violence and conflict, often from the moment they are born. As they live lives that are frequently cut brutally short, orcs revel in testing their strength against worthy foes, whether by challenging a higher-ranking member of their community for dominance or raiding a neighboring settlement. Many orcs seek glory as soon as they can walk and carry a blade or club, taming wild beasts or hunting deadly monsters.\nOrcs often struggle to gain acceptance among other communities, who frequently see them as brutes. Those who earn the loyalty of an orc friend, however, soon learn that an orc's fidelity and honesty are unparalleled. Orc barbarians, fighters, and rangers are prized as gladiators and mercenaries. While some human settlements might be hesitant to accept an entire orc community into their midst, a small handful of orc mercenaries can do the job of an entire squad of human conscripts, so long as the orcs are well fed and well paid. Though the belief that orcs are only suited for battle is pervasive among other humanoids, the harsh orc mentality comes from a long history of conflict rather than a lack of ability in other areas.\n Orc culture teaches that they are shaped by the challenges they survive, and the most worthy survive the most hardships. Orcs who attain both a long life and great triumphs command immense respect.\n If you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an orc.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Eagerly meet any chance to prove your strength in a physical contest. \n\t- Believe that lies and treachery are for those who lack the strength to seize what they want. \n\t- View dying in glorious combat as preferable to a mundane death from old age or illness.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- See you as violent or lacking in discipline. \n\t- Underestimate your intellect, cunning, and knowledge. \n\t- Admire your forthrightness and blunt honesty.\nHeading:Physical Description\nOrcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. The combination makes for a seeming contradiction, sharing an eye level with most humanoids while simultaneously towering over them. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rock-hard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Despite the roughness of their skin, orcs scar easily, and most orcs take great pride in the scars they have accumulated. Orc skin color is typically green and occasionally gray, though some orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.\n Orcs consider powerful builds and heavily scarred skin attractive, regardless of gender. A powerful orc makes the hold stronger, and scars are signs of victories won or hardships survived. Similarly, many orcs consider large, jutting tusks to be more attractive than smaller tusks, since the former make more effective weapons. Many orcs also find tattoos to be attractive, particularly large or painful ones that cover a significant amount of skin.\nHeading:Society\nMost orc communities define themselves through two things: pain and glory. Each earns respect in near equal measure, so long as the pain is borne with stoicism. An orc with many scars who walks uncomplaining with a broken leg draws as much admiration as one who wins a great victory on the battlefield.\n Power in an orc hold comes from strength or family lineage. The structure tends to be feudal, with weaker orcs working at the behest of the strong. The Hold of Belkzen is the largest such society, and power changes hands there quickly. One mighty orc dying in battle can shake up an entire power structure, leading to squabbling and duels to decide control. Many orcs who tire of being subservient split off to form their own warbands, traveling to new territory.\n Young orcs are typically raised by the entire community. Indeed, it would be almost impossible for orcs to raise their young any other way, since twins, triplets, and even quadruplets are quite common in orc families, as are deaths among orcs in their child-rearing years. Many orc holds conduct ceremonies when a young orc comes of age, typically around their tenth or eleventh birthday, during which the new adults are told what their role in the hold will be. For communities that practice ritual scarification or tattooing, this is often when the young orcs receive their first hold-scar or tattoo as well.\n Orcs fear very little, but most distrust magic. Magic is seen as a tool that bypasses the physical and allows the weak to contend with the strong, a belief that runs at odds with orc values. While they respect the physical might of Gorumite warpriests, and even druids who take on the forms of great beasts, they find arcane and occult magic questionable at best and unethical on the whole. All but the most depraved orc communities see necromancy as a foul art that steals glory from the dead, and their growing struggles against the undead have given them newfound common ground with their humanoid neighbors.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nA common orc saying is, \u201cYou are the scars that shape you.\u201d Violent, chaotic lives in violent, chaotic lands mean that most orcs tend heavily toward chaotic alignments. Gorum, Lamashtu, and Rovagug are all commonly worshiped among orc communities, though less violent holds worship nature deities like Gozreh or gods like Sarenrae, whose tenets of fire, redemption, and glory all hold some appeal to orc sensibilities.\n While there are orc deities, their worship is surprisingly uncommon among orcs. Orcs believe that if a creature has a face and a name, it can be killed, and so their own deities are targets, rather than objects of reverence. Some orc holds teach that the greatest members of the hold can earn a chance to challenge the orc deities for a place amid the pantheon. Most orcs don't waste their dying moments praising the divine or praying for a place in the afterlife, but spitting a blood-flecked warning at their deities, promising a new challenger through broken teeth.\nHeading:Adventurers\nAn orc's drive to overcome challenges and prove themself spurs many orcs to become adventurers, though orcs are more likely to set out on their own or with other orcs than alongside adventurers of other ancestries.\n Common orc backgrounds include gladiator, hunter, martial disciple, nomad, and warrior from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, outrider, and refugee from this book. Orcs thrive in martial classes like barbarian and fighter.\nHeading:Names\nOrcs have a harsh, guttural language, and their naming conventions are no exception. Many orc names are simply the Orcish word for a particularly desirable trait, such as great strength, height, or ferocity. Orcs commonly use either their hold name or a name referencing a particularly memorable accomplishment as their surname.\nHeading:Sample Names\nArkus, Ausk, Durra, Grask, Grillgiss, Krugga, Mahja, Murdut, Ollak, Onyat, Thurk, Uirch, Unach\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Orc History\nOriginating deep underground, orcs were driven upward when the dwarves began their Quest for Sky. Endless dwarf forces advanced from below, crossing into orc territory and inciting a war that lasted for countless orc lifetimes, with each new generation losing more ground. When finally driven to the surface, orcs discovered a world shrouded by ash. The nearby human civilizations were unprepared for their anger and desperation as they battled their way to empire with dauntless ferocity.\nHeading:Orc Holds\nOrc holds are large groups of orcs bound together by family, values, and loyalty. \nBurning Sun: Armed with their faith in Sarenrae, the Burning Sun hold is dedicated to directing orc culture toward a more righteous path. \nEmpty Hand: The Empty Hand hold collects taxes from trade in Urgir to acquire top-quality weapons and armor. The hold's renown reached new heights after they led a recent victory over the Whispering Tyrant's undead forces.\nHeading:Orc Settlements\nOrc settlements rapidly rise and fall, but a few have stood the test of time. \nGaraguum: In the Darklands, orcs inhabit a ruin built by their ancestors: the final battleground of their people's last stand against the dwarf invaders. \nScarwall: When the curse lifted from this haunted castle within the Hold of Belkzen, the local orc holds rushed to make their claim. The castle's lingering magic warped the minds and bodies of the orcs, who now call themselves the Spirit Skull Hold.\n",

  "description": "Ysoki-as ratfolk call themselves-are a clever, adaptable, and fastidious ancestry who happily crowd their large families into the smallest of living spaces\nMost surface-dwelling humanoids call ysoki \u201cratfolk\u201d and know them as a communal people who prefer cramped conditions, with up to 100 individuals living in a given house. If they can't find homes in town, ysoki may instead live in caves and cavern complexes, as these provide great storage for the many and varied goods they bring back from trading expeditions.\n Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found on the road in merchant caravans. They're good with their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They're also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous generations and stowed away in preparation for some future emergency.\n If you want a character who is smart, fast, well-traveled, and adaptable, try playing a ysoki!\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Have pride in your large extended family, and stay in contact with everyone in it. \n\t- Like to travel near and far in search of new experiences, likely collecting trinkets along the way. \n\t- Work well with others.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Mistake you for a wererat or another monster. \n\t- Are surprised by your careful grooming and other fastidious habits. \n\t- Think you're crowding them and invading their personal space.\nHeading:Physical Description\nRatfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or black fur. A common ysoki is 4 feet tall and weighs around 80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however; even a single family group can exhibit substantial variation in hair color, eye color, or size.\n Instinct drives ysoki to maintain cleanliness, though this is also reinforced through their strong social structures. Other condescending humanoids often presume ratfolk are dirty or diseased, but in actuality, they are meticulous about personal hygiene. Because their appearance is often considered unnatural-and other people mistake them for wererats-ysoki often conceal their physical features with hoods, gloves, shoes, long-sleeved tunics, robes, and other layers of clothing when moving through spaces dominated by other ancestries.\nHeading:Society\nYsoki culture values cooperation and community. Every ysoki learns-through communal games, social occasions, and sports-to forge fast friendships and connections with ysoki outside their family. You may never know whose help you're going to need, but when you do, you're going to need it now.\n With a long tradition of working as traders and tinkers, ysoki travel frequently from one town to another. Their wagons are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a dozen vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally large giant rats; many ysoki can speak to such animals.\n Discrimination against ysoki has shaped their culture, prompting them to rely on each other and strengthening their family and communal bonds. Ysoki are very good at differentiating between bad actors and those who are simply acting out of ignorance, modeling good behavior and slowly working to reverse generations of discrimination for those willing to learn. They are always on the lookout for members of other ancestries who don't judge them for their appearance, embracing these individuals as true friends and welcoming them into their communities. But they also can quickly spot determined bigots prone to violence and steer clear of such individuals, minimizing any opportunity for tragedy.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nYsoki care more about their family than abstract concepts of good and evil. Their warrens might be chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but they also obey strict social codes. Most ysoki are neutral.\n Though ysoki revere their ancestors and tend to acknowledge whatever deity is prevalent in their local area, Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki culture. Grandmother Rat, as she is sometimes known, embodies many things that are otherwise antithetical to ratfolk-she urges followers to put their own interests above others, and she encourages deceit and trickery. To most ysoki, Grandmother Rat accomplishes all those things ratfolk need done, but which no reasonable ratfolk would wish to do.\nHeading:Adventurers\nRatfolk might take up the adventuring life to explore and travel, to defend their family or community, or for any number of other reasons.\n Their natural wit and nimble fingers make ratfolk excellent alchemists and rogues, while some specialize in ranged weapons as fighters or rangers.\n Typical ratfolk backgrounds include animal whisperer, artisan, merchant, medic, nomad, scout, and tinker from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, barber, scavenger, and teacher from this book.\nHeading:Names\nEvery ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes with minor alterations or alternative nicknames. A grandfather might be Grivver, for example, while his daughter goes by Griva and her son is simply Griv. Ratfolk are often assigned nicknames and sobriquets by humanoids they interact with, but most ysoki find these names distasteful and endure them only when outside ysoki communities.\nHeading:Sample Names\nBarnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto, Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak, Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Ratfolk Settlements\nYsoki congregate at trading cities and crossroads of all kinds. In Avistan, ratfolk are somewhat more prevalent in Druma, the Five Kings Mountains, and Taldor, as well as port cities like Absalom and Riddleport. Others carve out warrens far from human settlements, such as Numeria's Chitterhome. Garundi ysoki congregate in Katapesh and the Mana Wastes (where they're in demand as alchemists and tinkerers), though many sail as far as Thuvia, the Shackles, and Vidrian. Ysoki dwell throughout Casmaron. They are respected in Kelesh and well established in the caravan city of Ular Kel. Diguo-Dashu, the famous \u201cEmpire of Rats,\u201d sprawls below central Tian Xia; however, ysoki also appear throughout that continent's Darklands, especially in the recently reestablished Second Ticker (see below) and the Deepmarket below Goka.\nHeading:Second Ticker\nFive centuries ago, the sorceress Hao Jin (Lost Omens Legends 46) thwarted a ratfolk surface invasion by transporting the ratfolk's Darklands province to her private demiplane. The demiplane recently collapsed, returning the sphere (now called Round Mountain) to its former site-thankfully just after Pathfinder agents had evacuated the area (then known as Broken Ticker). At first, the ysoki's delight at their reunification smoothed over the upheaval caused by Round Mountain's return. However, the event diverted nearby rivers and trade routes and caused many Broken Ticker ratfolk to lose their homes; the Round Mountain ysoki must now readjust to a world that forgot them; and Hao Jin is reluctant to arbitrate. The united realm of Second Ticker has thus become a powder keg, with only the threat of a nearby army of clockwork soldiers keeping it from exploding.\nHeading:Ysoki of the Red Planet\nTo Golarion natives, Akiton appears as a pink star winking in the evening sky. The handful of explorers who've gone there and returned tell of a desert planet peopled by red-skinned humanoids, four-armed giants, and- most surprisingly of all-ysoki almost identical to Golarion's ratfolk, even down to a shared common language. These ysoki are expert traders as well as superlative gadgeteers; while they invent little themselves, they can repair or reverse-engineer nearly any sort of widget.\n",

  "description": "Tengus are a gregarious and resourceful people that have spread far and wide from their ancestral home in Tian Xia, collecting and combining whatever innovations and traditions they happen across with those from their own long history.\nTengus are survivalists and conversationalists, equally at home living off the wilderness and finding a niche in dense cities. They accumulate knowledge, tools, and companions, adding them to their collection as they travel.\n The tengu diaspora has spread across Golarion in search of a better life, bringing their skill with blade crafting to lands far from their home. In maritime regions, tengus notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and \u201cjinx eaters\u201d- members of ships' crews who are believed, accurately or otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a variety of conditions and locations, tengus tend to be nonjudgmental, especially with regard to social station, though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has often led some to look at them with suspicion.\n If you want to play a character hailing from a rich history of artisanship and tradition, but who happily picks up new practices, companions, words, and items as needed, you should play a tengu.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Be gregarious and eager to find a flock of your own. \n\t- Voraciously absorb the practices of those around you, sometimes even forgetting where they came from. \n\t- Be willing to take on any task or job, no matter what others think.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Look to you as a source of eclectic skills and knowledge, especially relating to languages. \n\t- Get confused by your simultaneous respect for and disregard of tradition. \n\t- Have trouble reading your expressions or regard you with suspicion and superstition.\nHeading:Physical Description\nTengus have many avian characteristics. Their faces are tipped with sharp beaks and their scaled forearms and lower legs end in talons. As closed footwear tends to fit poorly unless custom made, many tengus wear open sandals or simply go barefoot. Tengus are rarely more than 5 feet tall, and they are even lighter than their smaller frames would suggest, as they have hollow bones. A small number of tengus have vestigial wings incapable of true flight.\n Tengus hatch from eggs and are featherless for their first year of life, during which they rarely leave home. They soon grow a downy gray coat, which is replaced by a dark covering of adult feathers by the time they come of age at around 15 years. Tengus use their shed feathers in a variety of tools, from simple writing quills to magical fans to focus their ancestral magic. Many tengus modify their appearance by dyeing patterns into their feathers or talons, which amplifies their body language and has the added benefit of aiding other humanoids in understanding their expressions.\nHeading:Society\nTengus are extremely social, banding together in extended communities with many families living in adjacent houses and sharing the work of the household. In cities, a community may also contain members of other ancestries. Tengu children raised in the same unit consider each other siblings, usually forgetting which of them share a biological connection.\n The greatest divide in tengu society is between tengus remaining in their ancestral home and those who have dispersed across the world. Tengus refer to these two groups as those \u201cin the roost\u201d and those \u201cmigrating,\u201d respectively. Roosted tengus tend to be more traditionalist and conservative and are especially concerned with preserving their culture in the face of years of erosion from oppression. Migrating tengus, on the other hand, voraciously absorb the culture of the various nations and settlements that they now call home.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nTengus often follow the faith of the region in which they were raised, though the tengu ancestral deity is the storm god Hei Feng. This god's notorious drunken carousing and emotional swings causes many tengus to instead focus their attention on gods of freedom and travel, such as Desna or Cayden Cailean, or deities of nature, such as Gozreh. Besmara is also a common subject of tengu worship, especially among tengus who live on the sea.\n Before their diaspora, tengus practiced a syncretic faith that blended a polytheistic worship of the deities responsible for creating the natural world. As tengu folklore posits that tengus long ago descended from the night sky on shooting stars to rest upon Golarion's highest peaks, animist rites were practiced on mountains and other great natural features. Even today, tengus rarely differentiate between divine and primal worship.\n Tengus are far more concerned with the balance between traditionalism and adaptability than they are with good and evil, with lawful tengus more common among the roosted and chaotic tengus more common among the migratory.\nHeading:Adventurers\nA tengu that leaves the ancestral homeland feels an intense pull toward adventure, to cross vast distances, collect beautiful treasures, and brave the challenges of combat or the rolling sea. \nTengu backgrounds might reflect their place in the homeland or the tengu diaspora. These could include acrobat, barkeep, charlatan, emissary, entertainer, fortune teller, gambler, merchant, nomad, or sailor from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, courier, insurgent, refugee, and scavenger from this book.\n Tengus often become rogue, bard, oracles, rangers, or swashbucklers.\nHeading:Names\nThough roosted tengus tend toward more traditional names with the hard consonants often seen in the Tengu language, migrating tengus' tendency to readily absorb and repurpose the culture of those around them has led to names that combine elements of whatever languages suited the namer's fancy.\nHeading:Sample Names\nArkkak, Chuko, Dolgra, Dorodara, Kakkariel, Kora, Marrak, Mossarah, Pularrka, Rarorel, Ruk, Tak-Tak, Tsukotarra\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Tengu Bottles\nTengu tend to have a healthy respect for gods that rule over storms and air-or at least, a healthy fear. One ancestral custom that has caught on among other sailors is the tengu bottle: a decorated gourd or other container filled with an offering for the gods, kept on ships and thrown overboard in the event of dire weather. Tengu bottles most often contain fine alcohol to appease the fury of Hei Feng or Besmara; crew puncture the bottles to release these offerings before throwing them into the waters.\nHeading:Tengu Settlements\nThe majority of tengu enclaves are found either in the Tian Xia nation of Kwanlai or on the continent of Garund; Kwanlai is part of the ancestral tengu homelands, while tengu communities on the Garund coast resulted from a troubling combination of lucrative job opportunities and kidnapping. Tengu also have a sizable presence in the nation of Minkai and the Forest of Spirits, and scattered communities dot much of northeast Tian Xia.\nHeading:The Storm God's People\nWhile Hei Feng's tempestuous blessings mean that some tengu prefer to pay the god lip service rather than follow his guidance, most tengu share the Duke of Thunder's love of loud and colorful celebrations-holidays dedicated to Hei Feng are nearly universal, in even the most far-flung communities. Likewise, many tengu enclaves put little faith in the stability of society. In situations where the future seems uncertain, Hei Feng's presence provides an outlet for feelings of helplessness.\n",

 "Changeling": {
  "source": "Advanced Player's Guide pg. 30 2.0",
  "description": "Tales of children stolen away and replaced by monsters exist across countless cultures- but the true monsters are the hag mothers of these strange children. After the hag seduces, uses, and disposes of their father, the changeling child is usually abandoned in their father's community to be raised among them. Such a child faces no end of challenges, often beginning life as an orphaned outsider.\nThough a changeling generally resembles a member of their father's ancestry, their distinctive eyes-each a different color-set them apart. One of their eyes matches that of their father's lineage, while the other matches the color of their hag mother's, often in an unnatural shade such as violet or a vivid green. Not everyone with differently colored eyes is a changeling, but this manifestation of changeling heritage makes it difficult for them to hide their nature and can lead to banishment from their community. As they come of age, they manifest other characteristics from their mother, including supernatural abilities. Darkvision, clawlike fingernails, and innate magic are the most common, but stranger abilities specific to the hag mother can also arise.\n Changelings can be any gender, but women in particular are vulnerable to the Call, a psychic influence that urges them to abandon their mortal life, join the hag's coven, and eventually become a hag. Changelings who understand their heritage often fear the Call and work to resist its pull. Those who remain ignorant of their origin may find themselves subject to a terrible compulsion without knowing why.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Cherish and protect those friends and family who accept you as you are. \n\t- Seek to better understand your hag mother and the gifts she gave you, for good or ill, or distance yourself from your heritage. \n\t- Fear the day you hear the Call and worry you might not be able to resist-or perhaps you already fight to resist it every day.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you practice occult or primal magic, or that you participate in a coven. \n\t- Worry that you might secretly be a monster, or become one, and turn on them. \n\t- Notice and speculate about your distinctive eyes.\nHeading:Adventurers\nDepending on their mother's choice of cradle, a changeling might grow up a farmhand or noble. Reclusive changelings might be artists, herbalists, tinkers, or hermits, while some find companionship as animal whisperers. More outgoing changelings might become charlatans or fortune-tellers or use their allure as merchants and entertainers.\n Changelings carry the potential for occult sorcery via their hag blood; the bard's path offers similar magic. Many changelings who find beauty in nature become druids or rangers, while changeling rogues make master manipulators with lethal claws. Changelings might become paladins or redeemers to protect what they love.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Changeling Origins\nChangelings' rarity typically prevents them from gathering in numbers. While changelings can be found anywhere hags lurk, they're most common by far in Ustalav, Irrisen, and neighboring regions. The daughters of night hags and moon hags can arise far from any known hag activity thanks to their mothers' extraplanar origins, as can the spontaneously arising sorrow may.\nHeading:Changeling Relationships\nGiven their desire for emotional intimacy, romance and love are often major aspects of changelings' lives. Some flit from one tryst to another, while others find dedicated lovers and cling to them tightly-sometimes enough to drive them away. While some changelings use their mystique to manipulate others, such attempts all too often end with the changeling actually falling in love, only to become heartbroken when their lover discovers their earlier duplicity. Changelings rarely feel comfortable with a single partner despite their desire for commitment. The most comfortable relationship structure for many changelings involves the changeling and two or more people, each in a relationship with all other members. However, these changelings are acutely aware that their hag blood is the likely source of this desire.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

  "description": "Many call vampires the children of the night, but it is dhampirs who can truly claim that title. These mortal offspring of vampires walk the line between life and undeath not just physiologically, but also in their social standing, temperament, and worldview.\nThe circumstances surrounding a dhampir's birth are rare, complex, and often shrouded in horrific rumors stoked by societal revulsion at the idea of an undead monstrosity producing mortal offspring. Some dhampirs are the child of one mortal and one vampiric parent, while others are born to those who were turned into vampires while pregnant. Still others rise from dark rituals or other supernatural influences that impose a vampiric curse onto a mortal infant. The life of a dhampir is often difficult: few vampiric parents have the time or inclination to raise a mortal child, while mortal communities find a dhampir's sallow flesh, piercing eyes, and unnerving presence off-putting at best.\nDespite being living creatures, dhampirs respond to positive and negative energy as if they were undead, making them unwelcome in many holy communities and often driving them toward necromantic arts. Dhampirs aren't immortal, but age far more slowly than most mortals, with a lifespan similar to that of an elf. Dhampirs have difficulty producing children of their own, and those few born to a dhampir are never dhampirs themselves.\n A dhampir generally resembles a member of their non-vampire parent's ancestry, but with a ghostly pallor and eyes so light it seems they have only pinpoint pupils and no iris. All dhampirs have elongated incisors, some nearly as long as those of a true vampire. Many command grace, beauty, and charm, despite their unsettling appearance.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Distance yourself from your heritage by trying to blend into society or even hunting undead. \n\t- Take special precautions to avoid being exposed to \u201chelpful\u201d healing magic. \n\t- Find yourself fascinated by the sight, smell, or taste of blood.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Feel unsettled by your ghostly pallor and sharp teeth. \n\t- Wonder about or even romanticize your origins and motivations. \n\t- Find themselves strangely drawn to your grace, charm, and appearance.\nHeading:Adventurers\nOutsider status combined with supernatural abilities make dhampirs natural adventurers. The criminal, hermit, nomad, and street urchin backgrounds are common among dhampirs, while those with better fortune might have the acolyte, noble, or scholar backgrounds.\n Dhampirs who practice magic are often undead-bloodline sorcerers, wizards of the necromancy school, or occasionally oracles or witches. Those who have learned to fend for themselves might be rogues or swashbucklers, and those who seek to slay undead might choose champion or ranger.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Dhampir Settlements\nThe Darklands city of Nemret Noktoria is home to a small, isolated enclave of dhampirs born to the city's vampire ambassadors. A similar dhampir community in the city of Kaer Maga welcomes kin from across the Inner Sea region. In Ustalav and the far reaches of Vudra, a few dhampir villages exist-but as the personal projects of vampires, these hamlets become horrors at night.\nHeading:Strigoi\nThe first vampires arrived on Golarion from the Shadow Plane, but most have died out, gone into hiding, returned to the Shadow Plane, or evolved into modern vampires. Those ancient few who retain their original form are called strigoi. These vampires aren't destroyed when exposed to sunlight- instead, they enter a dormant state from which they rise again at nightfall.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

 "Aasimar": {
  "source": "Advanced Player's Guide pg. 34 2.0",
  "description": "Born with the power of benevolent celestial entities, aasimars are thought to be supremely blessed with strength of will, extraordinary beauty, and innate magical gifts. But many aasimars find that these perceived talents-whether they actually have them or not-set them apart from their friends and family, fostering loneliness in themselves and jealousy in others.\nAasimars with a positive outlook face these challenges by serving their communities, populating the environment with kindness or artwork, or simply supporting those who are less fortunate. Some aasimars hold a more hostile worldview, however, and risk falling into resentment, despair, or even the temptations of evil. Even then, the stereotypes surrounding an aasimar cling close, causing others to view them as tragic figures in need of redemption.\nThe powers and physical appearances passed down from celestial beings vary according to an aasimar's lineage. Those who descend from archons are sometimes known as lawbringers, while those who possess angelic blood are called angelkin, and those related to azatas are referred to as musetouched.\n If you want a character brimming with celestial power, unique physical characteristics and the potential for strong faith, you should play an aasimar.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Possess a strong sense of fashion, favor exquisitely crafted tools, or carry yourself with instinctual grace. \n\t- Feel a strong kinship with outcasts, orphans, or others who have been misunderstood or marginalized. \n\t- Have a beloved pet or a close relationship with a sibling or childhood friend.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you are a supernatural messenger from beyond or whole-heartedly enjoy your supernatural legacy. \n\t- Treat you with worship or reverence, but distance you by putting you on a pedestal. \n\t- Think you can provide simple and free supernatural solutions for all their problems.\nHeading:Physical Description\nAn aasimar's physical appearance depends as much upon the features of their parents as it does upon the nature of their celestial heritage. While an aasimar is recognizably a member of their humanoid ancestry, they always bear a few physical traits that set them apart, such as glowing eyes, a faint halo of light above their head, feathers for hair, antennae on the brow, a metallic sheen to the skin, lack of a belly button, a strangely musical voice, or a naturally pleasing floral scent. It's a common stereotype that all aasimars are handsome or beautiful-another assumption aasimars face throughout their lives.\nHeading:Society\nAasimars are too widely dispersed in most regions to create societies of their own, and they instead tend to assimilate into the society and culture of their mortal parents. They thrive in societies that hold freedom, civility, and justice as virtues. Whether due to inborn charm and confidence or others' tendency to ascribe greater weight to their words, aasimars often find themselves in positions of leadership, even when they don't seek out such roles, and they must take care that their actions and words don't unduly influence others. When aasimars gather in numbers large enough to develop their own societies, they tend to be tightly knit but open and friendly to visitors, yet swift in their justice against proven enemies.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nAn aasimar's celestial nature doesn't force goodness or faith into their life-each aasimar is free to form their own personality and beliefs. In many cases, these beliefs are shaped by the nature of their upbringing, their parents, and the society in which they were raised. Most aasimars are good, whether because society tends to accept, foster, and support aasimars, or because the influence of the celestial planes is enough to subtly encourage them down such paths. Good faiths are more likely to draw an aasimar's attention, particularly those with portfolios associated with celestial concerns, such as Desna, Erastil, or Sarenrae. Those who choose lives of evil tend to be particularly cruel or sadistic, almost as if they feel the need to work that much harder to justify and pursue their life choices.\nHeading:Adventurers\nAasimars are often revered from birth, and communities often ensure that these blessed children are given every advantage to pursue their divine destiny. Pampered aasimars may have the artist, emissary, entertainer, or noble background. Aasimars pursuing virtuous ends may have the acolyte, detective, or field medic backgrounds. Aasimars often devote themselves to faith, becoming champions or clerics. Artistic aasimars excel as bards.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Divine Pressure\nSocieties expect great destinies from aasimars, and the pull of their celestial tether guides them towards noble pursuits. Most aasimars embrace these impulses, looking to prove themselves by answering the call. But this intense pressure from their peers and the celestials above may cause an aasimar to shirk their birthright and flee their homes, overwhelmed. There are also aasimars who resist the celestial call entirely, acting as a force for evil to spite their heritage.\nHeading:Tianjing\nDue to the nature of their births, aasimar have few dominions they can claim as their own. The aasimar nation of Tianjing in Tian Xia is a major exception, populated by the descendants of celestials who fought off a qlippoth invasion and known now for its skilled diplomats. Tianjing's aasimar crafters also display masterful skill in their chosen professions, and their finely made goods are coveted across Golarion. \nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

 "Duskwalker": {
  "source": "Advanced Player's Guide pg. 37 2.0",
  "description": "The first duskwalkers manifested as the result of a bargain between two powerful psychopomps, the immortal guardians and guides of souls after death. One believed that certain souls who helped preserve the cycle of life and death but had their own lives cut short deserved reincarnation, while the other felt this would too greatly violate that same cycle. In the end, the duskwalkers rose from a concession between the two that allowed such rebirths to occur but limited their frequency-only a finite number of duskwalkers ever exist at any one point in time.\nWhen they were first created by psychopomps, duskwalkers were expected to perform roles that would serve the goddess of death, Pharasma, and by extension her realm, the Boneyard. But now duskwalkers have found themselves with more freedom of choice and after a century, have only now come to terms with the fact that their destinies are their own to choose. As they are created, not born, most duskwalkers either struggle to integrate with society or seek out communities and organizations to serve as a surrogate family.\n Duskwalkers have an inherent understanding of the cycle of life and death. In most cases this manifests as a deep respect for that cycle and pushes the duskwalker toward occupations that help them to protect it, such as hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests.\n If you want a character who has a mysterious background, seeks a society or organization to join, or looks to fight against undead, you should play a duskwalker.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Seek out opportunities to form strong friendships with a diverse array of companions. \n\t- Become focused on preventing the spread of undeath. \n\t- Be intrigued at finding your identity in a previous life.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you're a necromancer or have some other strange interest in death or the dead. \n\t- Want to know if you remember your past life or ask you about the secrets of death or the afterlife.\nHeading:Physical Description\nAs a reincarnated soul, a duskwalker retains many of the physical traits they possessed in their previous life and is a member of that ancestry, though as a duskwalker they have distinctive ash-gray or dark blue skin. However, sometimes a duskwalker forms from an unusual creature, like a dragon. These duskwalkers appear to be of a humanoid ancestry, but have features like draconic scales or horns.\n When a duskwalker perishes and faces final judgment, a new one incarnates within a year from a deserving soul, typically somewhere far from the previous duskwalker's birthplace. Duskwalkers manifest in locations with a sanctified connection to death, such as graveyards or temples, and begin their lives at adolescence. No duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological children, but this doesn't prevent them from establishing families, typically through adoption.\nHeading:Society\nIt's not uncommon for a duskwalker to go their entire life without encountering another of their kind. Despite their overall rarity, duskwalkers are likely to become adventurers, both due to the strange conditions of their creation and common feelings of social isolation.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMost duskwalkers are neutral or have a neutral component to their alignment. While the typical duskwalker worships or at least respects Pharasma and her powerful psychopomp ushers, any deity associated with death, society, or the occult might attract a duskwalker's attention.\nHeading:Adventurers\nDuskwalkers become adventurers most often out of some sense of misplaced destiny. While duskwalkers have free will, they also feel the pressure to make good use of their reincarnation. Many duskwalkers choose to study the otherworldly arts and become wizards or bards. Duskwalkers are also more concerned than most with matters of the soul, commonly becoming clerics, champions, and monks. Duskwalkers most often come from the acolyte, fortune teller, hermit, martial disciple, and scholar backgrounds.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Duskwalker Origins\nDuskwalkers' past lives were often adventurers, but other origins might include a doctor who fought an undead plague or a gravedigger who encouraged a healthy attitude towards death.\nHeading:Taking Tea with Death\nPsychopomps can recognize a duskwalker on sight, and most types of psychopomp are much more likely to start up a conversation with a duskwalker they encounter during their appointed tasks than any other mortal. Nosois might trade shiny objects or sweets for tidbits of knowledge, morrignas might give a warning of a nearby undead threat, and so on. Rarely, a psychopomp might take a shine to a duskwalker and visit from time to time-though given the way psychopomps measure time, these gaps could be months, years, or even decades.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

 "Tiefling": {
  "source": "Advanced Player's Guide pg. 39 2.0",
  "description": "When the influence of a demon, devil, or other fiend infiltrates the bloodline of a mortal family, tieflings are the inevitable result. Tieflings carry the sinister mark of the fiendish planes upon their flesh, and their specific abilities and physical qualities vary according to their heritage. Hellspawn are those who descend from devils, grimspawn hail from daemonic influences, and pitborn bear the influence of demons, though these are only the three most common among a wide variety of tiefling lineages.\nGenerations might pass between a fiend's direct influence and the time a tiefling child is born. For those born to ignorant or fearful parents, childhood is particularly hard, but even those whose families accept and nurture them face fear and prejudice from society as a whole. In some cases, this rejection encourages a tiefling to embrace the evil within their heritage, though others carve out a place and live a fulfilling life despite the challenges facing them.\n If you want a character who is supernaturally infused with sinister forces, might have a unique appearance, and can fill the role of a complicated or unexpected hero, you should play a tiefling.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Have a strong sense of self-confidence born from a life of having to rely on yourself. \n\t- Feel a kinship with society's underprivileged or criminal elements, or even seek positions of power on the wrong side of the law. \n\t- Place incredible value on hard-won friendships and hold these companions closer than your blood family.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you've faced numerous challenges due to your heritage. \n\t- Mistake you for an evil agent of a sinister cult, a fiend worshipper, or even a fiend yourself. \n\t- Think you have associations with powerful fiends, potentially trying to bargain with you for power of their own.\nHeading:Physical Description\nTwo tieflings, even siblings or twins, might not look similar at all, for the influence of fiendish lineage manifests in unique and unusual ways. These variations never make a tiefling's appearance so strange as to obscure their humanoid ancestry, but horns, a forked tongue, vestigial wings, a tail, or a cloven hoof in place of a foot are all common and obvious signs of their heritage.\nHeading:Society\nTieflings tend to adopt the society and culture they were born into. Since most societies consider them to be untrustworthy or even monstrous, tieflings typically gravitate toward those segments of society willing to overlook them entirely, or where their reputation can assist rather than hinder them. With determination and persistence, however, tieflings can earn respect and prestige despite their heritage, finding people who accept them as they are. In regions where worship of fiends is widespread, tieflings can live more openly and achieve great power and respect, although exceptions exist-in the Asmodean nation of Cheliax, for example, tieflings are seen as shameful proof of a failure to maintain control in the face of fiendish influence, and as such are cast out.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nA tiefling's fiendish heritage doesn't force evil or cruelty into their being, and each tiefling ultimately chooses their own faith, goals, and personality. But every tiefling feels their forbear's influence in the back of their mind, always ready to tempt and goad when the world appears cruel and unjust. That so many societies hate and fear tieflings only pushes them further toward evil, and many tieflings gravitate toward religions that value and admire fiends, such as the churches of Asmodeus or Lamashtu. Tieflings who choose a path of good face their own challenges, finding they must be more diplomatic, understanding, and patient than members of other ancestries since they are so often faced with ignorance and suspicion. Such tieflings embrace faiths and philosophies that uphold empathy and eschew judgment, finding that even followers of good faiths sometimes struggle to see past fiendish features.\nHeading:Adventurers\nFor many tieflings, becoming an adventurer is a natural progression. The typical tiefling already relies on no one but themself or a few chosen comrades, lives a semi-nomadic existence to avoid trouble, and tends to have very developed opinions on good and evil and the necessity of intervening on one side or the other. Tieflings often grow up as outcasts, and the charlatan, criminal, hermit, nomad, and street urchin backgrounds might fit, with unluckier tieflings coming from the prisoner background. Many tieflings become rogues or bards as a means of survival, while others access the powers of their blood to become sorcerers. Some become wizards, monks, or clerics in an effort to gain mastery over their fiendish corruption.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Abandoned by Faith\nFew tieflings have positive relationships with the faiths of good-aligned deities. Sometimes this friction stems from ignorance; experienced priests might know to differentiate a tiefling from a demon, but a random lay follower might not. Sometimes it's just a clash of perspectives-tieflings are more likely to have seen the kind of darkness that makes holy idealism look laughable. Other reasons stem not from divine limitations but earthly ones, such as overstretched churches failing tieflings in need due to a lack of resources.\nHeading:Family Matters\nPowerful raja rakshasas see those beastbrood tieflings who can hide or disguise their fiendish features as potential infiltrators or agents and thus valuable pawns in the games they play to cement their influence. Rakshasas willing to wait for untold time might even seek out old enemies who reincarnated as tieflings and gain their trust so that, once the tieflings regain former status or achieve a new station, there's a debt to be repaid. Very few rajas do anything out of the kindness of their hearts, but some ask less of those they take a liking to- they might even become doting. This special treatment happens most often when they share a familial connection, see something of themselves in a beastbrood, or recognize the potential for greatness.\nHeading:The Shaded Library\nThe Shaded Library is a whispered network of dire claims about various deities of the multiverse. Though the name was given derogatorily, many immortals and extraplanar beings have come to embrace the Shaded Library. Tieflings, especially faultspawn, often catch wind of these truths: \n\t- Desna isn't simply carefree and filled with wanderlust-she actively distances herself from the woes and near catastrophes she has caused.\n\t- What Torag truly craves most is complete control.\n\t- Milani is likely an exceptionally powerful asura or lucky faultspawn.\n\t- Many rakshasas believe newly minted gods who perform the Test of the Starstone are reincarnations at best and, at worst, future asuras who don't believe the truth about themselves. Neither is complimentary.\n\t- Only a few deities are never held in contempt by the Shaded Librarian.\nHeading:Tiefling Settlements\nGiven the nature of fiends, tieflings are among the most common of planar scions, especially in areas where demonic or diabolic corruption is most powerful, such as in the lands of the Sarkoris Scar or under the rule of the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune in Cheliax. In such places, it's not unheard of for a few dozen tieflings to form their own small community. These places tend to be paranoid and precarious, sometimes worryingly vulnerable to the cults of dread gods or unholy fiends.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

  "trait": [
   "Android",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Technological wonders from another world, androids have synthetic bodies and living souls. Their dual nature makes them quick-thinking and calm under pressure, but comfortable in stillness and solitude.\nAndroids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria. While some android survivors of this crash still walk Golarion today, most were created from the technological pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the starship's wreckage. Androids birthed from these mechanical wombs possess mature bodies and newborn souls, both organic and synthetic; they emerge knowing only their creators' language and the motor skills necessary for survival. They have no understanding of their surroundings, origin, or purpose. Most learn how to behave through keen observation while wandering Numeria.\n Androids tend to be logical introverts, rational and contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to understand themselves and the world around them, androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds, they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.\n If you want a character that's a synthetic foreigner in a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality and society through the powers of observation and logic alone, you should play an android.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Keep your identity a secret, assuming others want to exploit or harm you.\n\t- Plan ahead, preparing multiple contingencies for even simple tasks.\n\t- Calculate the repercussions of your actions, inventions, and thoughts before sharing them.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you understand how to operate technology and that you can capably communicate with constructs and robots.\n\t- Believe you to be immortal and envy your eternal youth and vigor.\n\t- Think you have no feelings and that you can't form emotional connections with others.\nHeading:Physical Description\nAndroids were created in humanity's image; thus, foundries produce androids that represent all humankind. Androids display great diversity in coloration and ethnicity, height and body shape, and gender identity. Androids breathe, eat, and sleep like a human, although they're incapable of biological procreation. Their bodies contain microscopic nanites, transported by fluid too watery to be blood, that manage their organic processes. These nanites are controlled through biological circuitry that resembles tattoos and is typically located along an android's hands, forearms, face, or neck. Many androids can harness their nanites to increase their bodies' efficiency, causing the circuitry to glow.\n Androids don't grow old. Instead, their organic appearance becomes less convincing over time, causing them to look more artificial. After a century, most androids feel their time coming to an end and willingly release their souls to the Boneyard to face Pharasma's judgment. Their bodies then shut down, entering a lifeless hibernation as their nanites begin restoration protocol and reset their synthetic bodies to their original manufactured state. After a few weeks, a new soul enters the android's form, triggering reinitialization. This process, called Renewal, is an event to be celebrated, akin to bearing a child. Those that die by violence can't Renew, so androids go to great lengths to protect themselves and their brethren from harm.\nHeading:Society\nAndroids have a history of being exploited, enslaved, and destroyed by their Numerian neighbors, so they hide in order to survive. Most choose to keep their ancestry secret by integrating into human society or by adapting to a nomadic lifestyle. Some androids eschew humanity to live among their kind. Such groups often remain small by necessity; while a pair of androids can avoid danger through careful secrecy, large groups attract too much attention.\n Android communities are efficient and highly organized. Each citizen understands their role and takes pride in filling it effectively. Debates and lectures frequently occur, as androids seek to understand themselves and their world through education and inquiry. These insular and secretive enclaves relocate when discovered.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMost androids are neutral. They care for their own safety and that of their companions and their kind. Androids interested in religion usually worship Casandalee or Brigh, goddesses that unite invention and life. Other popular deities include Desna, Irori, and Gozreh.\nHeading:Adventurers\nMost androids become adventurers to protect their kin from harm or to research the history of their people, typically by exploring technological ruins. Androids survive through deception, stealth, and subterfuge, which leads many down the path of the rogue. Others embrace their thirst for knowledge and understanding by becoming alchemists, monks, or wizards. Typical android backgrounds include hermit, nomad, scholar, and tinker.\nHeading:Names\nAndroids adopt the naming conventions of their surrounding societies, while those raised among their own kind instead select a single name that utilizes Androffan phonology. Occasionally, such androids add a numerical designation to their names, denoting how many generations their body has hosted life as a kind of homage to their bloodline.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAnati, Daniv, Era-4, Feralia, Gelegor, Ilgos-5, Koresh, Oris, Prime, Urdun, Verity-3, Ymry\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Android Settlements\nAndroids are primarily found in Numeria, where they hide among humans or travel as nomads. A large number live openly in Starfall under the protection of the Black Sovereign. The slopes of Silver Mount house multiple android enclaves and archaeological teams, including Enseffa, the center of Androffan society. In the town of Hajoth Hakados, the locals help androids secretly flee Numeria for lands where they face less hatred. Hidden in a series of tunnels and caverns beneath the Numerian Plains, the androids of Szamrak's Haven believe androids are a superior life-form. They hunt for foundries with the intent of liberating all androids, conquering Numeria to found an android-only nation, and eventually returning their people to their home amongst the stars.\nHeading:Casandalee and Androids\nOnce an artificial intelligence cloned from the mind of an alien android, Casandalee recently ascended as the goddess of artificial life, free thinking, and intellectual apotheosis. Despite the small size and relative obscurity of her religion, the androids of Numeria have embraced Casandalee as their own. They seek to better bridge the gap between artificial and organic lifeforms, thereby improving the lives of androids.\nHeading:Thoughts on Androids\nOther people view androids through a lens of magic and superstition. Most consider androids eccentric spellcasters, often confusing them with tattooed Thassilonian wizards. Others see an android's glowing circuitry and assume they're planar scions. In the River Kingdoms, androids are often thought to be fey that imperfectly took on human form and thus can't stand the touch of cold iron. Peoples in Ustalav frequently confuse androids for spirits, believing they can be held back by salt circles or banished through pious prayers.\n",

 "Aphorite": {
  "source": "Ancestry Guide pg. 74 2.0",
  "description": "Once perfectly identical beings who bridged the gap between Axis's perfect order and mortals' unrestricted existence, aphorites are now lit more by the spark of free will than the beacon of cosmic law.\nAphorites were first forged by axiomites, the primary inhabitants of the Eternal City of Axis, the plane of pure law. The original aphorites served as liaisons between their lawful progenitors and frustratingly unpredictable mortal allies. Marrying the logical thought processes of conformity to law and the gift of self-determination, early aphorites spread across the Material Plane to serve as Axis's proxies and enact its will. Over time, their appearances and personalities grew to resemble their mortal comrades as they were increasingly born among mortals. Aphorites still exhibit Axis's touch in their metallic skin coated in crystalline dust, aptitude for logic, strength in artisanship, and propensity for order and cooperation. But despite these links to their purpose-built origins, contemporary aphorites are undoubtedly their own masters.\n If you want to play a character intrinsically tied to the underlying order of the universe, walking the thin line between calculated predestination and free will, you should play an aphorite.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Seek to make something work just a bit better, whether a physical object or process.\n\t- Enjoy learning the intricacies of a language, machine, or profession.\n\t- Gain satisfaction in working alongside others.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Believe you're rigid in your beliefs or habits.\n\t- Think you never act before considering every possible outcome.\n\t- Assume you easily grasp complex systems and situations.\nHeading:Physical Description\nThe first aphorites appeared as perfectly identical humanoids with metallic complexions; modern aphorites are far removed from such rigid biological structures. Their size, shape, and features now vary, but they still visibly bear the influence of Axis. Eyes, hair, and complexions with a metallic sheen are almost universal. These tones usually vary between copper, gold, and silver, though cobalt, viridian, and carmine aren't unheard of. Other manifestations include skin infused with shimmering crystalline motes or glowing symbols appearing across the body in a consistent rhythm.\nHeading:Society\nWhile still relatively rare, aphorites are increasingly born into families with no direct aphorite ancestors, and have thus spread across the Material Plane. They acculturate like any other mortal, picking up local customs and mannerisms over time. Most aphorites intuit an underlying sense of order or pattern that supersedes mortal law or custom. Some pursue this through cultural norms, while others balk at what they see as poorly constructed systems.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nThe gift of free will means aphorite alignment is frequently shaped through experience rather than Axis directives. Good and evil hold no particular sway over aphorites' souls, but most do bend toward a lawful worldview.\n Many aphorites revere Abadar, Asmodeus, Erastil, or Torag, whose faiths recognize the benefits of a stable society. Desna appeals to some aphorites' desire to break from tradition. For aphorite artisans, Shelyn's aesthetic and Brigh's precision prove attractive; the Bronze Lady's views on awakened constructs also appeal to axiomite-forged aphorites.\nHeading:Adventurers\nMany aphorites share backgrounds in the trades. Artisans and tinkers all find fulfillment in the intricacies of their work. Some aphorites instead navigate laws and other social structures; these might work within the legal system as barristers or emissaries. Acrobat and scout aphorites enjoy the interplay of mind and muscle, as do hunters, martial disciples, and warriors. The aphorite eye for detail leads many to become investigators or rangers. Similar faculties lead them to become alchemists, oracles, or wizards.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Aphorite Settlements\nA few sites around the Inner Sea region host aphorites in greater-than-average concentrations. \nEgorian: The order of Hell is omnipresent in Cheliax's capital. This rigid structure also attracts Axis's influence, and a fair few aphorites excel among the infernal contracts and complex political machinations of the City of Thorns. \nNantambu: The ancient Song-Wind City maintains a complex web of diplomatic and professional relationships throughout the Mwangi Expanse. Aphorites help spin these silk-strong strands, while others study the multiverse's nature at the Magaambya Academy. \nOrder's Berth: An aphorite majority populates this agglomeration of boats and barges. The fleet plies Lake Encarthan's waters, seeking out those most affected by the region's conflicts and offering their aid as artisans, physicians, and negotiators.\nHeading:Relations with Axis\nThe ancient bonds between aphorite and axiomite are still encoded within the minds of the aphorites' creators. Few of Axis's hybrid children are called to fulfill these contracts' terms, but the Godmind, the collective consciousness that rules Axis, can still reach between worlds to draw aphorites to the Eternal City. Some individuals serve as interpreters for the rigid axiomites and their more chaotic allies. Others have their mental faculties tapped, providing mortal imagination for the Godmind's calculations.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

  "trait": [
   "Fetchling",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Once human and now something apart, fetchlings display the Shadow Plane's ancient influence through monochrome complexions, glowing eyes, and the casting of supernatural shadows.\nFetchlings are a striking people whose skin appears entirely drained of color. These lithe and shadowy beings seem to sink and vanish into the gloom. They see in darkness, exercise control over shadows, and have strange occult powers. Some fetchlings develop their powers enough to pass between the Shadow and Material Planes, leaving other ancestries to whisper about figures that emerge from shaded corners and then vanish without a trace. Through magic and other means, they've spread across Golarion and the planes beyond, as adaptable as the humans they once were.\n The first fetchlings were refugees. Ages ago, when Earthfall destroyed ancient Azlant and cast the world into darkness, one small group of Azlanti pleaded for rescue. A mysterious hooded figure known as the Widow answered their call, slicing open a passage into the Shadow Plane. The Azlanti stepped through, trading the darkness of Earthfall for a deep shadow. As they navigated the plane's strange environs and dangerous inhabitants, its nature slowly worked monumental changes on the survivors.\n If you want a character more at home in a mirror world of shadow, infused with umbral gloom, and who embodies the dualities of light and darkness, you should play a fetchling.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Live and work in gloomy areas of dim light with plenty of shadows, only providing bright light when expecting visitors.\n\t- Look to people's shadows as a way of identifying them, alongside features like stature or facial structure.\n\t- Maintain composure when faced with strange creatures and circumstances.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Believe you have shadowy powers, such as the ability to consume light as food, melt into darkness, or travel between planes.\n\t- Expect you to be cautious, reserved, and a loner.\n\t- Express interest in your ancestral physiological connection to the Shadow Plane.\nHeading:Physical Description\nMost of the Shadow Plane appears as an altered version of the Material Plane but leeched of color. These same forces in the Shadow Plane have touched fetchlings, whose skin tones fall on a monochromatic scale from stark white to deep black, and all the shades of gray between. Their bodies are just as diverse in shape and size as humans, though most display a certain fluidity of motion reminiscent of shifting shadows. Fetchlings' reflective, pupilless eyes can pierce darkness. A fetchling's most notable feature is their shadow, which almost never faithfully reflects their body. Instead, fetchling shadows might have incongruous shapes or sizes, while others flicker, move of their own accord, or imitate the shadow of another nearby creature.\nHeading:Society\nMost fetchlings remain close to Golarion on either the Material or Shadow Planes, either forming majority-fetchling communities or forging solitary paths. Both planar groups tend to be insular; many fetchling cultures preserve memories of their early, perilous days confronting the Shadow Plane's hostile or beguiling denizens. Their predilection for forming tight communal bonds and adapting to local customs has spread to become part of broader fetchling culture, reinforced by two major fetchling groups-the Estlaris and Sharedars-who live in the shadow of more powerful entities.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nA culture of survival passed down through generations means many fetchlings prefer to maintain a cautious worldview and adapt to prevailing circumstances. As a result, many trend toward a neutral outlook on life. Some choose to join with local powers for personal or communal advancement, or to tear systems down from the inside. Others attempt to shatter what they see as fetters that bind them and their communities.\n No small number of fetchlings are nonreligious, recognizing all gods' powers but revering none. Faithful fetchlings prefer gods that offer protection and stability, be it the pastoral embrace of Erastil or the binding chains of Zon-Kuthon. Those who travel alone or pass between planes seek the comfort of Alseta, Desna, and Gozreh. Calistria appeals to ambitious fetchlings, while Grandmother Spider and Sivanah help those who wish to move through the world unnoticed or unfettered. Some worship these three as a pantheon called the Laughing Veil; a few even include Norgorber as a fourth member.\nHeading:Adventurers\nFetchlings have a well-earned reputation as travelers. Their merchants and emissaries ply many roads, while nomads and sailors seek what lies over the next horizon. Charlatans, criminals, and street urchins carve livelihoods from inhospitable environs. Many fetchlings leverage their natural litheness as swashbucklers or rogues. The Shadow Plane's caress awakens hidden power in many fetchling bards or sorcerers (especially those of the shadow bloodline) or drives them to study deeper mysteries as witches or wizards\nHeading:Names\nFetchlings adapted to a new world, and their names do the same. These names commonly include phonetic qualities from multiple languages or are simply local cultural names that fetchling families find compelling. Other dominant naming conventions include flowing sounds, harsh or hissing consonants, and surnames that refer to important relatives or community traits.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAmelisce, Ashka, Drosil, Eitsanara, Eomva, Ikyamek, Inva, Jegan, Lirtae, Meotrai, Sorsul, Zokaratz\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Fetchling Settlements\nMany fetchlings congregate in these two cities. \nBeacon (Shadow Absalom): Estlaris ignore their city's official name on Golarion and instead call their home Beacon. Velstracs and intelligent undead prowl the city's sparsely traveled streets, but business thrives behind closed doors and in towering d'ziriak hives. Ships cross the parched Bay of Dusk to bring diverse wares that fuel warring factions, while the Glare at Beacon's heart can send visitors back to the exact spot from which they entered the Shadow Plane. \nCandlease: This island of terrace farms, natural spires, and colorful woven bridges floats in the sky beneath Shadow Golarion's moon. In the Tallow amphitheater, the timely gleaming of obsidian standing stones helps predict the Lacrimosas that both take and replace Somal's Tears. Candlease also hosts storytelling contests and Brightsorrow moots.\nHeading:Kayal\nMany fetchlings refer to themselves as kayals, an Aklo-derived word with a meaning akin to \u201cshadow people.\u201d Most kayals reject the term fetchling, which they see as imposed on them by individuals bound too closely to the Material Plane. The word has uncertain origins, but its use is widespread in Nidal. To kayals in Nidal, their name grounds and uplifts them as a worthy people forging their own paths, not as servitors of darkness. Skeptics consider kayal to be a superficial affectation.\nHeading:The Widow\nThe Widow was one of the Forsaken- sinister demigods who once watched over the Shadow Plane. It heard an Azlanti call for rescue, lifted its shivering sickle, and tore a passage into darkness; those it ushered into the Shadow Plane became the first fetchlings. Few remember anything beyond the Widow's name, and fewer still offer it prayers. It grants power to no fetchling priests.\n",

   "Aberration",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Fleshwarps are people whose forms were created or radically transformed by magic, alchemy, or unnatural energies. Their unorthodox appearance can make it difficult for them to find a place for themselves in the world.\nMagic and science that can warp bone and twist sinew are all too common on Golarion. Fleshwarps are those who have been permanently altered by such methods-sometimes a sapient being created whole cloth from inanimate flesh, but often a victim unwillingly transformed by strange energies or sadistic creators.\n The ancestry name \u201cfleshwarp\u201d is an umbrella term, since on Golarion the actual fleshwarping process is more infamously well-known than are alterations caused by uncontrolled magic, technology, or fringe science. Whether practiced by Thassilonian wizards, Nexian fleshcrafters, or the drow of the Darklands, fleshwarping is the craft of reshaping flesh and mind in vats of foul magical reagents. This has led some scholars of monsters to argue that only those beings created by traditional fleshwarping should be considered fleshwarps. Regardless of the source of their altered forms, fleshwarps bear their new shape forever, transformed beings living a wild and strange existence beyond what was possible for their original ancestry.\n Although fleshwarps are humanoid, no two look the same. One might possess limbs in unusual places and skin as smooth as glass, while another might have a thick matting of spiny fur. Some might have animalistic features, like a boar snout, scales, or cloven hooves. Others have entirely alien appearances, such as bulging eyes on the backs of their hands. Some may have only subtly uncanny features that differentiate them, such as glowing teeth, smoking eyes, or fingernails made of bone. The only commonality among fleshwarps is their mismatched nature. Let your imagination run wild when creating a fleshwarp character!\n If you want a character who is tough and hardy, can change their form as they grow, and can use their wholly unique appearance to inspire awe or fear in others, you should play a fleshwarp.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Embrace your unusual appearance to inspire respect or fear.\n\t- Be used to relying on yourself.\n\t- Distrust large groups of people, particularly mobs, based on past experiences.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Find your physiology fascinating or terrifying.\n\t- Assume you are an expert on strange creatures or occult phenomena.\n\t- Consider you an enigmatic and unpredictable-and perhaps even dangerous-outsider.\nHeading:Physical Description\nFleshwarps are humanoids, ranging from 5 to 7 feet tall and from just under 100 pounds to more than 300 pounds. The proportion and appearance of their limbs and features differ widely, but fleshwarps functionally have two legs, two arms, and a single head; a fleshwarp with more limbs than this should consider an appropriate ancestry feat to reflect this variance, or one of their limbs might be vestigial and mostly nonfunctional. Fleshwarps differ widely in their appearance due to the unique circumstances of their creation. Even fleshwarp siblings or two people transformed through the same procedure might look wildly different.\nHeading:Society\nFleshwarps are so few in number that congregations of them are rare. They most often live on their own, with a small family group, or at the outskirts of a community. Some thrive in cities, however, where they can remain anonymous among the crowds while pursuing careers that allow them to avoid contact with people who might fear or persecute them.\n Fleshwarps value endurance and are quick to learn from others, so those who come into contact with others of their kind usually share stories that help each other survive, hide, or thrive more effectively. How a fleshwarp formed can be a painful or horrifying subject, one they consider rude to discuss with anyone besides close friends or loved ones.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nFleshwarps have little to gain from the broader society, and therefore rarely work to support society in turn, beyond perhaps helping other fleshwarps. They need to be able to adapt quickly to survive on their own. As a consequence, few fleshwarps are lawful. Although bigoted or short-sighted people view fleshwarps as monsters, fleshwarps are no more or less prone to evil than any other people, and most seek only to live their lives without trouble. Most are neutral in alignment, for while alienation doesn't force a fleshwarp to feel contempt for others, neither does it encourage a fleshwarp to avoid it. This is especially true for fleshwarps living in the societies that gave birth to their traumatic transformation. Fleshwarps aren't often casually religious; most either have little to do with faith at all (viewing themselves as scorned by the gods or simply seeing faith as impractical for survival) or are exceptionally devout. Religious fleshwarps often revere Arazni, Calistria, Desna, or Gozreh; evil fleshwarps typically turn to Lamashtu, finding consolation in the Mother of Monsters.\nHeading:Adventurers\nFleshwarps often live on the margins of society. The hermit, hunter, nomad, or street urchin backgrounds work well for many fleshwarps; others might be criminals, entertainers, or prisoners. The need to defend themselves leads many fleshwarps to become barbarians, fighters, rogues, or rangers. champions and druids are common callings among fleshwarps who seek to defend and better the lot of others of their kind.\nHeading:Names\nFleshwarps can come from-and thus have names from-any culture or ancestry, but some give themselves new names after being transformed, whether to celebrate the change, recognize a new phase of their lives, or conceal their past identity. Many fleshwarps also carry a descriptive nickname granted to them by others, such as \u201cTriple Handed,\u201d \u201cBarkfoot,\u201d or \u201cMany-Mouth.\u201d Fleshwarps don't keep nicknames they find personally offensive, but they tend to keep ones that describe their distinctive appearances or that are given by people they care about.\nHeading:Sample Names\nBorble, Dag, Feff, Hurn, Kemp, Omber, Ostro, Shurni, Surm, Wumpin\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Fleshforges\nIn the city of Ecanus, the archmage Nex created the Fleshforges-massive edifices that churn and tremble with the birth sequences' roar of smelting flesh and printing bone-to produce fleshwarp soldiers to fuel his war against Geb. The Fleshforgers still engineer a bedazzling array of fleshwarps here, from chimeric messengers, who meld house pet and golem, to disciplined scale-sheathed cataphracts and stupendous dreadnoughts, whose fists and footsteps bend steel and pulverize stone. Recently, the Fleshforges have experienced uninitiated activations with alarming frequency, delivering atypical fleshwarps unconfined by design purviews or production schedules. Ecanus's authorities fervently hunt these unlicensed creations, but some escape, lurching into the night to hide in the city's recesses or venturing afield into the Mana Wastes.\nHeading:Fleshwarp Legends\nLegends of famous fleshwarps travel quickly amid fleshwarp communities. \nLady Kedley: A wealthy noble in a life she doesn't remember, Kedley emerged transformed from deep below Westcrown. She uses her family's vast fortune to aid other fleshwarps. \nSpinhead Vanluk: This Mana Wastes warlord brings mutants and fleshwarps under his banner. He (literally) has eyes in the back of his head.\nHeading:Fleshwarp Motives\nFleshwarps have a variety of reasons for taking up the life of an adventurer. Some are turned out of their homes by an uncaring parent or a suspicious mob. Other fleshwarps travel to learn more about their own transformation or to seek out others of their kind. A few even actively seek the means-either technological or magical-to undo their transformations or adopt a new form that won't incite repulsion or fear in common people. Still others understand that a good way to earn respect is to solve a community's problems-then quickly leave the area-and therefore fall into the role of itinerant adventurers-for-hire.\nHeading:Fleshwarp Settlements\nNo settlements consisting entirely of fleshwarps exist openly outside of the Mana Wastes; elsewhere, citizens keep the secret so well that their community's existence isn't known to the world at large. Fleshwarps are more likely to live on the fringes of other settlements, working in industries where their hardy constitution is an advantage and their uncanny appearance isn't a liability. Some are herbalists or trappers, working in the wilderness and interacting with others only rarely. Locals might come to consider a fleshwarp their equal or friend, and take umbrage at outsiders who make a big deal out of the \u201cmonster\u201d in their midst. Sentiment might turn quickly upon supernatural events or strange attacks, however, and, tragically, more than a few fleshwarps have been turned out of homes they've occupied for decades when faced with a misguided mob.\nHeading:The Mana Wastes\nThe Mana Wastes are the vast swaths of desolation adjoining once-warring Geb and Nex. Over more than a thousand years, both nations' unrestricted use of magical fusillades, creeping plagues, and other atrocities of spellcraft transformed a once fertile and beautiful land into a desert where reality screams and bleeds. Wellspring surges of magic form into riptides and whirlwinds of chaotic force throughout the Mana Wastes, rending and twisting everything in their path. Many fleshwarps make their homes in this inhospitable land. Some are native to the region, mutated by the Mana Wastes' volatile outbursts, while others are exiles and refugees from across the Impossible Lands who find the otherworldly hazards of the Mana Wastes preferable to the all-too-worldly persecution of their former homelands and compatriots.\n",

  "description": "Children of chaos, ganzis are born of the roiling effervescence of the untamable Maelstrom, the primal sea of all creation. Their blood crackles with the promise of change and the raw power of creation unshackled.\nWhile some ganzis are born of mortals who mingled with the inchoate beings of the Maelstrom, and some are descended from those who sailed that cerulean void, many others are born in places where the Material Plane frays toward chaos. Whatever their roots, all ganzis share the same potent essence.\n More than any other planar scions, ganzis are prone to appearing in otherwise stolid and unremarkable bloodlines. While this is sometimes cause for scandal in less open-minded communities, most ganzi children grow up as happy and loved as any other child. Ganzi children often exhibit irrepressible energy and good-natured mischief. A few even grow out of these tendencies eventually.\n If you want a character that channels the spontaneous and the unpredictable, that defies categorization while still finding commonality with other nonconformists, you should play a ganzi.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Express your individuality through fashion and other personal choices.\n\t- Behave in dramatic or exuberant ways and refuse to get discouraged easily.\n\t- Look for creative or unique solutions to problems.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Expect you to behave unpredictably or impulsively.\n\t- Fear that you possess magic beyond your control.\n\t- Assume you're related to proteans.\nHeading:Physical Description\nWhile ganzis resemble other members of their ancestry, it's rare for chaos to manifest with any degree of subtlety. No two ganzis are wholly alike and there are no universal traits, yet there is more commonality among ganzis than a layperson might expect. While some ganzis have links to other creatures of chaos, like valkyries or einherji, and some to no known beings, a narrow majority manifest as \u201cproteankin\u201d ganzis. Whether actually related to proteans or not, these ganzis possess serpentine tails with colorful scales and feathers, as well as patches of feather and scale in other places. Bilateral symmetry of such features is ubiquitous, despite their chaotic origins.\n Given their dramatic physical features, most ganzis are accustomed to drawing attention. Some lean into this, dressing in daring outfits and developing exuberant personalities, while the more introverted use concealing clothing to hide their heritage. Regardless of social preferences, many ganzis share a passion for works of craft or artistry; ganzis often seek out craftworks as fashion statements, from bracelets to necklaces to brooches.\nHeading:Society\nAs a highly individualistic and geographically scattered heritage, ganzis have few widespread traditions. The most common, though, is the heart-name. While ganzis are no more likely than others to take issue with their gift-name (as ganzis call given names), the vast majority of ganzis choose names for themselves, selecting or inventing names that better describe their true selves. Some use their gift- and heart-names interchangeably; some share a name only with close friends or lovers; and some discard their gift-name entirely. Heart-names aren't static, and a ganzi might change their heart-name a day or a decade later.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nUnsurprisingly, ganzis lean heavily towards chaos, favoring organizations like the Firebrands. This is hardly universal, however-even a few suits of Hellknight armor accommodate a feathered serpent tail. Likewise, many ganzis find themselves suited to the service of Desna, Cayden Cailean, and other powers that value freedom and individuality.\nHeading:Adventurers\nGanzis come from all walks of life. Some find joy entertaining others and learn the skills of acrobats, entertainers, or gladiators. Others focus on creative pursuits as artists or tinkers, or as charlatans. The rogue and bard classes suit ganzis' love of chaos and mischief, while those looking for the thrill of combat often become swashbucklers or even liberator champions. Ganzis might study illusion magic as wizards or witches.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Ganzi Features\nThe features that distinguish ganzis from their mundane kin are extremely varied, as befits their chaotic nature. Proteankin ganzis are the most iconic, with feathery hair, iridescent scales, and long serpentine tails. Ganzi tails are notoriously full of mischief, with even their attached ganzi sometimes baffled by their antics.\nHeading:Ganzi Settlements\nSince ganzi births tend to be unexpected and ganzis themselves prone to wanderlust, very few ganzi settlements appear on Golarion. Until recently, the best-known locus of ganzi activity was the city of Anuli in southern Garund; ganzi creativity has contributed a great deal of art (and the occasional crater) to the celestial-blessed city.\n Even before the fall of Sarkoris, that region's thin planar boundaries resulted in more ganzi births than normal. In the wake of the Worldwound's closure, many ganzis have journeyed there. Some seek to wipe out the area's demons and restore the land to its people, while others wish to explore the blasted realm or even settle in the region. Today, the Sarkoris Scar hosts more ganzis than anywhere else in Avistan.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

Their spark of ancestral flame gives them a reputation for being passionate, if not capricious.\nIfrits often build up personal relationships between themselves and the idea of fire, feeling as though they embody it mentally or spiritually, in addition to physically. Some ifrits relate to fire's mutable energy, illuminating properties, or destructive nature.\n Some ifrits share a connection from birth to specific aspects of elemental fire, such as radiance, ash, or lava; this is called an ifrit lineage. Ifrits often have the same lineage as their parents, though sometimes ifrits are born with lineages different from their families, or to parents without one. Lineages can appear in ifrit children as a reflection of where they were born-for example, cindersoul ifrits sometimes originate from being born in areas prone to forest fires. They can also occur as a reflection of the ifrit's planar ancestry, such as a brightsoul ifrit having a fire-themed celestial ancestor like a peri. Magma ifrits with the lavasoul lineage are most often born the descendants of magma dragons or other lava-themed fire elementals.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Relate your personal identity to elemental fire and believe fire represents core aspects of your personality.\n\t- Always keep yourself moving and busy, traveling to new places or trying new things, for fear that slowing down may dim your inner fire.\n\t- Take great pride in your elemental lineage, especially if you believe you are related to the mighty efreeti nobles, the maliks.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Look to you as an authority on fire magic or the elemental planes.\n\t- Think of you as a never-ending well of passion and inspiration, with an inner spark that never dies.\n\t- Assume you must be hot-headed and reckless, acting before you think.\nHeading:Physical Description\nJust as their elemental origins can vary, so too can ifrits' otherworldly appearances. Red, orange, and brass are all common skin colors, while others have charcoal-gray, ash-brown, or radiant white, yellow, or blue hues. Ifrit hair often falls in untamable coils of flame that grow over the ifrit's lifespan. Salamander-descended ifrits can have lizard-like scales, while those descended from efreeti may have huge, red horns curling up from their skulls.\n Many ifrits keep their skin uncovered and open to the air, favoring loose or breathable clothes made in light fabrics like silk and chiffon. Their styles often feature bright colors and bold patterns paired with metallic jewelry.\nHeading:Society\nIfrits are typically born into societies built by others, where they comprise minority populations. Most ifrits place a high value on their freedom, and though they might live within societies and cultures dominated by humans, elves, or dwarves, many carve out peaceful, productive, and fulfilling places for themselves. Because most ifrits aren't bothered by high temperatures, many gravitate toward workplaces that get uncomfortably hot for other mortals, like forges.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nIfrits are fiercely independent, sometimes valuing their personal freedoms above those of others around them. Though frequently accused of lacking morals by their detractors, ifrits who tend toward mischief are rarely motivated by malice. The most common alignments among ifrits are lawful neutral and chaotic neutral, with the rest typically falling into true neutrality, neutral good, or neutral evil.\n Ifrits are rarely inclined to venerate Golarion's deities, typically resenting the strictures and rules of an organized faith, but those who do most often worship deities of fire or the sun, such as Sarenrae and Shizuru, or one of the Elemental Lords of Fire, like Ymeri or Atreia.\nHeading:Adventurers\nIfrits who choose to set out as adventurers usually have backgrounds as artisans, artists, entertainers, and merchants. Ifrits who choose to become champions are often redeemers, especially when they enter the service of Sarenrae, and ifrit clerics tend to worship deities who hold fire in their areas of concern, such as Shizuru, Atreia, and Ymeri.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Family Relations\nThe most common elemental ancestors for ifrits are efreet, the fire genies native to the Plane of Fire, but they have many possible otherworldly progenitors. Salamander-descended ifrits are usually born with tails and forked tongues. When magma dragon mate with mortals, their children are sometimes born as ifrits with draconic tails and vestigial wings.\nHeading:Geniekin Cuisine\nFor geniekin, food is about elemental unity. The tradition of tea is particularly important in Jalmeray, and geniekin tea makers-undine and ifrit in particular-are known for their ability to tease subtle flavors and aromas out of blends. Oread and sylph cuisine emphasizes aroma above all things, infusing rice or wheat with cardamom, cloves, anise, and other spices that create complex and intense tastes. In recent years, ifrit cuisine has taken a turn toward eating dangerous animals and plants. Whether it be snapping flytrap salad, lemon-fried dragonfish fillet, or herb-crusted cockatrice breast, the thrill of taming a dangerous creature into culinary art has become a trend. Oread cooks use components from spellcasters and alchemists in Nex and machinists in Alkenstar; with such ingredients, they create dumplings that hold far more soup than they should, cakes that produce bursts of sparks, and even entr\u00e9es whose steam spells out the cook's name.\nHeading:Geniekin Trendsetters\nGeniekin often find tight clothing restrictive and prefer generous, flowing garments. Recently, this trend has spread from geniekin to everyone in Jalmeray, with people of any gender wearing skirts, though the fabric tends to be cut and folded differently based on the outfit. Jewelry, perfume, and makeup, which geniekin of any gender use to express inner elemental identity, are likewise broadly fashionable there.\n Geniekin dancers enjoy the benefits of celebrity and patronage among the urban elite across the Impossible Lands. For geniekin, dance forms a narrative, and they often recreate ancient Vudrani tales with elemental flair. Performers accompany the music with ankle bells or, in places of great natural beauty, with the sounds of the elements themselves. In recent decades, geniekin dance companies have emerged, touring the Impossible Lands and spreading their cultural influence.\nHeading:Ifrit Settlements\nThe City of Brass, the largest city on the Elemental Planes, has a population that overshadows even the greatest cities on Golarion. More ifrits are born here than anywhere else, though they are born second-class citizens. Cinderveil, an ifrit city on the Plane of Shadow, was founded 100 years ago when a mountain corresponding to the location of the Eye of Abendego on the Material Plane erupted in ash and dust.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

 "Oread": {
  "source": "Ancestry Guide pg. 104 2.0",
  "description": "The Plane of Earth's influence runs through an oread's family, most often from a shaitan or crystal dragon ancestor. Oreads tend to be stoic, steadfast, and dependable, but they contain depths not seen on the surface.\nOreads can be slow to reveal their true selves, or perhaps more accurately, have enough depth and mystery inherent to their beings that they can reveal new and unexpected facets of themselves every day. They usually feel that they personify certain aspects of earth, stone, or other sediments or minerals, such as a cliff's tenacious resilience against erosion, the generosity and nourishment of fertile soil, or the versatile utility of metal and stone.\n Oreads born with a special connection to a specific subset of elemental earth, such as crystal, dust, or mud, might have an oread lineage. A lineage can be inherited along a family bloodline, or it can manifest spontaneously in oread children. They can be caused by where an oread's ancestors lived, frequently seen in dustsoul oreads, many of whom are born in a desert or to a family that has farmed for generations. Lineages can also be the result of specific planar heritages. Gemsoul oreads often have a crystal dragon in their lineage, and miresoul oreads descend from the more sodden creatures of elemental earth.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Relate your personal identity with elemental earth and believe stones or mountains represent core aspects of your personality.\n\t- Value moments of peace and quiet seclusion where you can be alone with nature.\n\t- Take great pride in your elemental lineage, especially if you believe you are related to the austere shaitan pashas.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Look to you as an authority on earth magic or elemental planes.\n\t- Think you are wise and cautious, moving into action only after you have considered a problem from all angles.\n\t- Assume you are stoic and quietly strong, keeping your thoughts and feelings to yourself.\nHeading:Physical Description\nOreads have the same diversity in height, body type, and physical characteristics as any other member of their mortal ancestries, alongside a handful of other traits that distinguish them as geniekin. Their skin is often gray or brown, but can also resemble metals and precious stones, with copper and iron veining or crystals that grow out of their skin. Instead of hair, oreads often have crystals or rocks that grow from their heads; regardless, most oreads sculpt, decorate, or otherwise maintain the appearance of their hair, whatever form it takes. Almost all oreads have shimmering gemstone eyes, beautiful and multifaceted.\n Oreads usually dress in sturdy clothes that can withstand physical labor and exposure to the elements, like wool and leather. Many choose clothing that will expose their unique characteristics, tailored to show off any crystals embedded in their rocky skin.\nHeading:Society\nBorn and raised within the societies of their mortal families, oread children are often (though not universally) described as shy and quiet, growing up to be patient, observant, and clever. They gravitate toward careers that allow them to work in peaceful contemplation with their thoughts, present opportunities to work with their hands, or ideally, both. Many oreads become miners or crafters who work with the earth, such as stonemasons, metalworkers, or gem cutters.\n Oreads also tend to enjoy opportunities to uphold structures or systems, and many find their vigilance and patience well-suited for careers as guards, wardens, or clerks. Oreads born in rural communities find fulfillment working and living on the land in a peaceful, self-sufficient harmony with nature.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nOreads are known for being steadfast and reliable, often placing high value on personal honor and keeping their word. Many are fiercely protective of their friends but less concerned for the safety of those outside their circle. The most common alignments among oreads are true neutral and lawful neutral, with the rest typically falling into other neutral alignments like neutral good or neutral evil.\n Religious oreads find that lives of silence, contemplation, or seclusion suit them well, and most dedicate themselves to the worship of earth and nature deities like Torag, Ashukharma-the Vudran deity of canyons and cliffs-or one of the Elemental Lords of Earth, Sairazul and Ayrzul. The nature-focused philosophy of the Green Faith also appeals to many oreads, especially those who become druids of the stone order. An oread's contemplative nature also aligns well with the teachings of Irori and Gruhastha.\nHeading:Adventurers\nOread adventurers usually come from artisan, herbalist, and miner backgrounds. Many oreads work with their hands as craftspeople, creating their work out of stone, metal, gems, or other forms of their ancestral element. Oread clerics tend to worship one of the Elemental Lords of Earth (Ayrzul or the still-imprisoned Sairazul) or the dwarven god Torag, or follow the path of the Green Faith. Druid and ranger oreads are common, with most druid oreads following the stone order.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Family Relations\nMost oreads are descended from shaitans, genies native to the Plane of Earth, but other planar creatures, especially other earth elementals, can also have oread descendants. The children of earth and mud mephits are typically born smaller than their mortal parent, with modest vestigial wigs or nubs in their backs where a mephit's wings would have been. When a dragon, crystal dragon bears oread offspring, they almost always have the gemsoul lineage in addition to draconic features like wings or a tail. Xorns are the least common elemental ancestors for an oread, as they seldom have relationships with mortals.\nHeading:Geniekin Cuisine\nFor geniekin, food is about elemental unity. The tradition of tea is particularly important in Jalmeray, and geniekin tea makers-undine and ifrit in particular-are known for their ability to tease subtle flavors and aromas out of blends. Oread and sylph cuisine emphasizes aroma above all things, infusing rice or wheat with cardamom, cloves, anise, and other spices that create complex and intense tastes. In recent years, ifrit cuisine has taken a turn toward eating dangerous animals and plants. Whether it be snapping flytrap salad, lemon-fried dragonfish fillet, or herb-crusted cockatrice breast, the thrill of taming a dangerous creature into culinary art has become a trend. Oread cooks use components from spellcasters and alchemists in Nex and machinists in Alkenstar; with such ingredients, they create dumplings that hold far more soup than they should, cakes that produce bursts of sparks, and even entr\u00e9es whose steam spells out the cook's name.\nHeading:Geniekin Trendsetters\nGeniekin often find tight clothing restrictive and prefer generous, flowing garments.

Performers accompany the music with ankle bells or, in places of great natural beauty, with the sounds of the elements themselves. In recent decades, geniekin dance companies have emerged, touring the Impossible Lands and spreading their cultural influence.\nHeading:Oread Settlements\nMost oreads prefer to integrate into the communities of their birth rather than settle their own cities, but over time, oread communities naturally develop and grow in areas with concentrated oread births. The dwarven Sky Citadel Janderhoff in southwestern Varisia has a large oread population. Dwarf elders speculate that its proximity to Crystalrock, a cavern in the Mindspin Mountains where crystal formations pulse with a heartbeat, is responsible.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

 "Suli": {
  "source": "Ancestry Guide pg. 108 2.0",
  "description": "Sulis are geniekin who embody a mixture of elements, most commonly air, earth, fire, and water. They are typically the descendants of jann, genies of all four elements that wander the Material Plane instead of making a home on the Elemental Planes.\nAt birth, a suli resembles their mortal ancestry, not manifesting their otherworldly heritage until adolescence, when they awaken into their elemental power. Strong in body and will, sulis are dynamic and ever-changing, and most feel they embody either all the elements together at once or the traits of different elements at different times. Some see themselves as having multiple aspects or faces to their personalities-one for each element-that they cycle through over the course of days or weeks.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Relate your personal identity with the mixture of elements within you, believing you have sides that befit each element.\n\t- Work to harmonize or broker peace and understanding in the world around you.\n\t- Be prone to bragging, both about your own accomplishments and those of your family or allies.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Rely on you for your elemental abilities and expertise.\n\t- Think you must be descended from a janni, if they recognize that you are a geniekin at all.\n\t- Assume your position at the nexus of opposing elements means you are a neutral diplomat.\nHeading:Physical Description\nOf all geniekin, sulis most closely resemble their mortal ancestries, and many could be easily mistaken for a non-suli As children, they appear wholly mortal; a suli's otherworldly characteristics only begin to develop when they awaken into their power in adulthood, which some refer to as a second puberty. Most adult sulis have eyes that glow with a supernatural light or shift color depending on the element they are attuned to at that moment. Adult sulis are also prone to asymmetry or physical traits manifesting only on one side of their bodies, such as developing heterochromia, beauty marks, freckles on one side of the face but not the other, or vitiligo on half of the body. Their skin often takes on a metallic (especially bronzy) sheen after their awakening, as well.\n Most sulis choose utilitarian clothes, expressing themselves through jewelry that highlights their glowing eyes or metallic skin, or with tattoos that symbolize their journey through life.\nHeading:Society\nMost sulis can conform to the societies they're born into. They tend to be highly social and gravitate toward jobs or societal roles where they will be seen by or interact with the public, whether working in restaurants or performing on a stage. Sulis often prize fame and recognition, wanting themselves or the people close to them to be known and remembered, and many take up artistic hobbies like songwriting, poetry, or painting to memorialize people and places they hold dear.\n Some suli-jann try to seek out their immortal ancestors, but the nomadic jann  rarely invite sulis to live among them. Instead, jann encourage sulis to enter mortal societies, hopefully working to influence the Empire of Kelesh from the inside and end the enslavement of genies. Many sulis become drawn into this conflict; some do so to impress their immortal ancestors, but most simply abhor slavery.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMost sulis are intense but adaptable people, valuing inner strength and truth over conformity or peace, often respecting others for living their personal truths more than for sharing common values. Sulis usually have a neutral component to their alignment; true neutral is the most common alignment among them, with lawful neutral, chaotic neutral, neutral good, and neutral evil suiting most other sulis.\n Sulis are typically only religious if raised in a religious society, but those that heavily invest in their faiths or become clerics tend to follow gods of duality like Nethys and Gozreh, gods of creation and alchemy like Qi Zhong and Brigh, or gods of travel like Desna and Alseta. Shelyn is also popular among sulis who identify themselves with the process of artistic creation, seeing themselves as a beautiful whole made of disparate parts.\nHeading:Adventurers\nSulis often come from artisan, bounty hunter, emissary, or nomad backgrounds before becoming adventurers. Sulis' elemental manifestations in adolescence cause many of them to seek answers about their heritage; these sulis typically train as acolytes or scholars. Classes that focus on creation or the combination of elements, such as alchemists and wizards, appeal to the multi-elemental nature of many sulis, while others pursue classes like bard that combine martial and magical disciplines. Suli monks often focus their attention inward, harnessing the elemental potential within themselves and exploring their inherent connection to the elements through their martial art.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Family Relations\nMost sulis are descended from jann, a type of genie that embodies the connection and interaction between the four elements. These suli are known as suli-jann, though the fact that a suli could have any ancestor other than a janni is often lost on non-sulis. Other sulis are the children of creatures that encompass multiple elements, or are the children of two geniekin tied to different elements (such as an oread and an undine).\nHeading:Geniekin Cuisine\nFor geniekin, food is about elemental unity. The tradition of tea is particularly important in Jalmeray, and geniekin tea makers-undine and ifrit in particular-are known for their ability to tease subtle flavors and aromas out of blends. Oread and sylph cuisine emphasizes aroma above all things, infusing rice or wheat with cardamom, cloves, anise, and other spices that create complex and intense tastes. In recent years, ifrit cuisine has taken a turn toward eating dangerous animals and plants. Whether it be snapping flytrap salad, lemon-fried dragonfish fillet, or herb-crusted cockatrice breast, the thrill of taming a dangerous creature into culinary art has become a trend. Oread cooks use components from spellcasters and alchemists in Nex and machinists in Alkenstar; with such ingredients, they create dumplings that hold far more soup than they should, cakes that produce bursts of sparks, and even entr\u00e9es whose steam spells out the cook's name.\nHeading:Geniekin Trendsetters\nGeniekin often find tight clothing restrictive and prefer generous, flowing garments. Recently, this trend has spread from geniekin to everyone in Jalmeray, with people of any gender wearing skirts, though the fabric tends to be cut and folded differently based on the outfit.

Performers accompany the music with ankle bells or, in places of great natural beauty, with the sounds of the elements themselves. In recent decades, geniekin dance companies have emerged, touring the Impossible Lands and spreading their cultural influence.\nHeading:Suli Settlements\nLike their jann ancestors, sulis tend to wander or live nomadic lives more often than settle down in a single city. Golarion's largest populations of jann wander the Windswept Wastes of Casmaron, and many families of sulijann can also be found there. In the city-state of Merab in Thuvia, sulis' skill with mixing and understanding elements is held in high esteem by the local alchemists and magicians, and some suli elementalists move there, at least for a time.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

 "Sylph": {
  "source": "Ancestry Guide pg. 112 2.0",
  "description": "Sylphs are an intense and lively people, flighty and tempestuous. These planar scions have kinship to beings of elemental air such as djinni, invisible stalkers, and cloud dragons.\nSylphs enjoying following their own tempos, shifting between wild energy that draws all eyes to embodying the spirit of unseen breezes that slip away without note. They often build their identities around their perceived personal connection to the element of air, relating to a gentle breeze, a sudden flash of lightning, or an uncontrollable storm.\n Some sylphs are born with a connection to an extremely focused aspect of elemental air, such as smoke, storms, or toxic gas. While it does happen, a child is rarely born with a lineage that differs from their parents', as geniekin typically pass these unusual gifts on to their offspring. Lineages can manifest in sylph children as a result of where they're born, such as when stormsoul sylphs are birthed in regions prone to tornadoes or windstorms. A lineage can also reflect a sylph's elemental heritage like in smokesoul sylphs, who often descend from belkers. Fumesoul sylphs, on the other hand, are associated with poisonous and otherwise unbreathable gases.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Relate your identity with the element of air and believe the wind and storms represent core aspects of your personality.\n\t- Enjoy traveling and exploring high, secluded places where you can observe the world beneath you.\n\t- Take pride in your elemental lineage, especially if you believe you are related to the gregarious djinn viziers.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Look to you as an authority on air magic or the elemental Plane of Air.\n\t- Believe you easily flow through all aspects of society, while listening to those around you.\n\t- Assume you must be airheaded or capricious, prone to irresponsible behavior without regard for consequence.\nHeading:Physical Description\nLike all geniekin, sylphs are recognizable as members of their ancestries with unique characteristics that identify their planar heritage. Their skin and hair can be any color of the sky, ranging from cloudy whites to the twilight tones of dawn and dusk. Complex, swirling marks dance across the skin of many sylphs, resembling shifting summer clouds. Some have skin cool to the touch, while others are surrounded by a constant static. Their hair can move with a life of its own, and they're often accompanied by light breezes that follow them everywhere they go.\n Sylphs typically prefer clothing in light, airy fabrics such as silk and linen, cut in loose and voluminous styles that flow in the breeze. Many of them deliberately wear chimes and jewels that jingle in the wind, though more stealthy geniekin endeavor to keep everything pinned down.\nHeading:Society\nSylphs exist within the societies of other ancestries, usually that of their mortal families, and it's incredibly common for them to have a sense of never quite belonging. Most sylphs engage in a practice known as \u201clistening to the wind,\u201d keeping their eyes and ears open to all that happens, often making their companions uncomfortable in the process. For sylphs, this habit of vigilance and information-seeking helps them feel connected to the world around them. A curious and restless bunch, many sylphs seek out occupations and lifestyles that allow them to travel and explore.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMost sylphs place little value on laws and tradition, preferring to forge their own paths and go where the wind blows, especially as many have a great love for subterfuge and trickery, placing them at odds with nearly all laws and social norms. Overall, they tend toward neutrality, pursuing the most expedient avenues toward accomplishing their goals, regardless of legality.\n Sylphs often find themselves drawn toward the mysteries of secretive cults, worshipping outsider demigods like the elemental lords of air Hshurha and Ranginori, or the empyreal lords of detectives and vigilance Zohls or Tanagaar. Those who worship conventional deities tend to favor gods of travel like Desna, gods of secrets such as Norgorber, or the obvious gods of air, Gozreh and Hei Feng.\nHeading:Adventurers\nSylphs who become adventurers often have backgrounds as acrobats, entertainers, nomads, and scouts. Traveling beneath an open sky or exploring the highest mountains is irresistible, and this drive to always reach for the sky drives many to pursue a life of adventuring. Sylph champions are most often liberators, and clerics typically serve gods of air such as Hei Feng or the elemental lords of air. Many sylphs are sorcerers with draconic or elemental bloodlines or wizards that focus on elemental magic.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Family Relations\nDjinn, air genies native to the Plane of Air, are the most common elemental ancestor for sylphs, but they are not the only possibility. Invisible stalkers look down on corporeal creatures, but occasionally they take mortal lovers, especially illusionists who share their appreciation for the unseen. Cloud dragons sometimes have sylph descendants, born with draconic features like tails or horns.\nHeading:Geniekin Cuisine\nFor geniekin, food is about elemental unity. The tradition of tea is particularly important in Jalmeray, and geniekin tea makers-undine and ifrit in particular-are known for their ability to tease subtle flavors and aromas out of blends. Oread and sylph cuisine emphasizes aroma above all things, infusing rice or wheat with cardamom, cloves, anise, and other spices that create complex and intense tastes.

Recently, this trend has spread from geniekin to everyone in Jalmeray, with people of any gender wearing skirts, though the fabric tends to be cut and folded differently based on the outfit.

In recent decades, geniekin dance companies have emerged, touring the Impossible Lands and spreading their cultural influence.\nHeading:Sylph Settlements\nBecause sylphs are fond of travel, there are few true sylph settlements on Golarion. In the Shackles, many are born near the Eye of Abendego, and those Shackles sylphs are often drawn to the chaotic mysteries of Ilizmagorti, an enigmatic city run-and largely obfuscated from outsiders-by the Red Mantis. In the Terwa Uplands of the western Mwangi Expanse, Mbe'ke sylphs who pass through use their people's Sky Citadel as a temporary or seasonal home. \nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

 "Undine": {
  "source": "Ancestry Guide pg. 116 2.0",
  "description": "These dynamic, fluid mortals trace their ancestry to creatures from the Plane of Water, such as marids, water mephits, and brine dragons.\nUndines often go through life in a series of shifting phases, their interests waxing, waning, or sometimes morphing altogether as old loves are discarded for new interests. Structure provides a much-needed focus to undines' lives, and without strong goals or support from those around them, undines can find themselves stagnating in feelings of despondence. Most undines feel they personify specific aspects of water, some seeing themselves with the strength and power of the waves, the speed and tenacity of a river current, or the calm of a peaceful lake or pond. Others identify with all these aspects and more, their demeanors shifting like the tides from one situation to the next.\n Undines born with a connection only to a specific subtype of elemental water, such as ice, brine, or mist, might have a specific undine lineage. These are typically passed down from parent to child, as with other geniekin, but on occasion, a child is born with a lineage never seen in their family. Sometimes lineages are the result of where an undine's ancestors lived, such as rimesoul undines being born in the cold northern countries or at the tops of mountain peaks. At other times it can be related to the undine's elemental heritage, as is often the case with brinesoul undines, who usually descend from brine dragons. Mistsoul undines might have a distant but powerful connection to elemental water, or might even have a bit of elemental air mixed into their ancestry.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Relate your identity to elemental water and believe the streams and tides represent core aspects of your personality.\n\t- Be equally comfortable above the waves as you are beneath them.\n\t- Take great pride in your elemental lineage, especially if you believe you are related to the formidable marid shahzadas.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Look to you as an authority on water magic or the elemental planes.\n\t- Think you can speak with aquatic creatures.\n\t- Assume you are easily swayed by others, with few real opinions of your own.\nHeading:Physical Description\nWith all the same diversity in height, body type, and physical characteristics as any other member of their ancestries, undine coloration runs a vast breadth of variation. Most commonly, an undine's skin and hair mimic the colors of the lakes, seas, or oceans near where they were born, ranging from the palest of blues to sea greens and navies. A rare few undines may even take on the bioluminescence of deep-sea fish, the bright colors of corals and anemones, or the pale bone hues of seashells. More unusual traits can include fin-like ears, thin layers of shimmering fish scales covering their bodies, coral growths at their joints or temples, tails with caudal fins, and even webbed hands and feet.\nHeading:Society\nUnlike other geniekin, undines create and congregate within their own tightly knit communities near water or floating on top of it. Undine neighborhoods that develop within larger cities, typically near the docks or directly on the water, are informally known as flotillas. Because undines deliberately create and seek out these communities, their children usually have healthy childhoods focused on the values of fellowship and harmony. This stands in contrast to many other planar scions, who all-too-often grow up feeling like outsiders.\n Undines typically gravitate toward occupations that allow them to live and work near water, and many of them excel at fishing and sailing thanks to their love and understanding of the sea.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nUndines are flexible and community-minded, often valuing the overall health of their communities above that of any one individual. Usually of a neutral alignment, their moral concerns are often centered around their societies rather than their actions.\n Religion isn't a major part of most undine's lives, but they often have strong spiritual connections to their supernatural ancestors or to water itself. Some undines worship deities of water, such as Gozreh or Hei Feng, while others might offer their prayers to Lysianassa, the lost elemental lord of water.\nHeading:Adventurers\nUndines often come from the animal whisperer, artist, and sailor backgrounds before becoming adventurers. The artist background is especially common among undines descended from marids, and undines raised on the Plane of Water in their parent's courts often develop their skills as bards. Undine clerics usually serve water deities, while most undine sorcerers possess the elemental or genie bloodlines.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Family Relations\nMost undines descend from marids- the water genies native to the Plane of Water-and the mortals they take for lovers. These mercurial genies usually show their favor to musicians, dancers, and other artists, inviting mortals of exceptional talents to live with them. Other planar creatures occasionally have undine progeny as well. The children of water, ice, and salt mephits are often born with small statures, nub-like horns, hooked or beak-like faces, or vestigial wings and tails. Those related to brine dragons are sometimes born with draconic wings and tails and almost always have the brinesoul lineage.\nHeading:Geniekin Cuisine\nFor geniekin, food is about elemental unity. The tradition of tea is particularly important in Jalmeray, and geniekin tea makers-undine and ifrit in particular-are known for their ability to tease subtle flavors and aromas out of blends. Oread and sylph cuisine emphasizes aroma above all things, infusing rice or wheat with cardamom, cloves, anise, and other spices that create complex and intense tastes. In recent years, ifrit cuisine has taken a turn toward eating dangerous animals and plants. Whether it be snapping flytrap salad, lemon-fried dragonfish fillet, or herb-crusted cockatrice breast, the thrill of taming a dangerous creature into culinary art has become a trend. Oread cooks use components from spellcasters and alchemists in Nex and machinists in Alkenstar; with such ingredients, they create dumplings that hold far more soup than they should, cakes that produce bursts of sparks, and even entr\u00e9es whose steam spells out the cook's name.\nHeading:Geniekin Trendsetters\nGeniekin often find tight clothing restrictive and prefer generous, flowing garments. Recently, this trend has spread from geniekin to everyone in Jalmeray, with people of any gender wearing skirts, though the fabric tends to be cut and folded differently based on the outfit. Jewelry, perfume, and makeup, which geniekin of any gender use to express inner elemental identity, are likewise broadly fashionable there.\n Geniekin dancers enjoy the benefits of celebrity and patronage among the urban elite across the Impossible Lands. For geniekin, dance forms a narrative, and they often recreate ancient Vudrani tales with elemental flair. Performers accompany the music with ankle bells or, in places of great natural beauty, with the sounds of the elements themselves. In recent decades, geniekin dance companies have emerged, touring the Impossible Lands and spreading their cultural influence.\nHeading:Undine Settlements\nUndines are the geniekin most likely to form their own settlements and communities, whether on Golarion or the Plane of Water. Many undines live in Outsea, a semi-aquatic River Kingdom with a powerful, primal connection to elemental water. In Tian Xia, the Wanshou state was struck by a series of storms that flooded the land; now, many of Wanshou's children are born as undines.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

   "Humanoid",
   "Kitsune"
  ],
  "description": "Kitsune are a charismatic and witty people with a connection to the spiritual that grants them many magical abilities, chiefly the power to shapechange into other forms. Whether they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers of the societies around them.\nKitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a fox-headed humanoid and one largely depending on where they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a tailless form-a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox.\n Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live among people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters.\n With dual forms and a connection to both the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have diverse concepts of self and identity. Some even view their forms as separate individuals altogether, using them to explore different aspects of their personality.\n If you want to play a character with innate magical talents and countless hidden facets, each revealed with a glint of the eye and a twisting grin, you should play a kitsune.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Studiously observe the habits of those around you, taking mental notes on how to imitate them better.\n\t- Delight in jokes, clever wordplay, pranks, or unnecessarily complex plots.\n\t- Present a different, but authentic, side of yourself in each new situation.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Are taken in by your magnetic personality and enigmatic nature.\n\t- Marvel at your many supernatural abilities.\n\t- Wonder what you aren't telling them.\nHeading:Physical Description\nKitsune have alert vulpine ears, pointed snouts, and short, semi-retractable claws on their fingers and toes. Their fur is dense, countershaded, and most often red, tan, black, or white in color. Kitsune have bushy tails that grow in number as they hone their innate magical abilities, to as many as nine.\nHeading:Society\nKitsune are rarely the majority in whatever communities they inhabit, and many go their whole lives without meeting another kitsune beyond their family. Their society, as much as it exists, centers primarily around the commonalities that kitsune find as they pass among other peoples. The same social perspective that helps them imitate others also makes them quick to notice signs that someone may need help or a kind word. Due to this, kitsune often form strong interpersonal relationships and tend to anchor their social circles.\n When two kitsune do meet, they may find themselves exchanging light verbal repartee, enjoying the sport of trying to outwit each other. While it's considered a grave offense to outright give away another kitsune's shapechanging nature, kitsune relish surreptitiously forcing another to \u201cbreak character,\u201d shocking the other into disrupting their transformation through a well-placed comment.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nKitsune often have neutrality in their alignment from balancing their dual natures, though their instinct for stirring up trouble leads many to lean slightly toward chaos. Some possess the ability to control or bend the will of others, but even among those that do, only the evilest use these arts flippantly or selfishly. The patron kitsune deity is Daikitsu, the goddess of crafting and agriculture. Though not all kitsune necessarily worship Daikitsu, most respect her as the purported source of their powers. Kitsune in Tian Xia often revere both Shizuru and Tsukiyo, seeing the duality of the sun and moon in their own multifaceted nature. A small sect of Avistani kitsune worship Sivanah, the goddess of illusion, respecting her position between perception and reality and believing the goddess's true form to be that of a kitsune-hidden behind not seven veils, but nine.\nHeading:Adventurers\nKitsune who live among others often have the charlatan, emissary, entertainer, fortune teller, merchant, noble, or nomad backgrounds. Those kitsune who strike out alone favor the acolyte, bandit, or hermit backgrounds. Kitsune often excel as rogues, investigators, and bards. Kitsune who hone their magical abilities lean more toward sorcerers or oracles, and those who forge a stronger connection to the spirits may become witches.\nHeading:Names\nWhile kitsune have some traditional names, they're more likely to use names that are unremarkable in their local society, the better to pass unnoticed. Some have different names for each form: a kitsune name for their kitsune form, a regional name for a tailless form, and possibly no name at all for a fox form.\nHeading:Sample Names\nHamako, Haohiko, Kitsukou, Kon, Kwan-la, Talaro\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Fox Families\nDue to their shifting nature, kitsune often have mixed-ancestry family units. The children of a kitsune and a non-kitsune can inherit either of their parent's lineages, though many assume that a human baby born to a kitsune is simply a kitsune that has yet to reveal their true form. This has led to the widespread misconception that all offspring of kitsune are themselves kitsune.\nHeading:Kitsune Settlements\nThough kitsune live all around the world, two major kitsune settlements exist on Golarion: Kihime in Tian Xia, and Angen in the Inner Sea region. Kihime, the central settlement for Souko kitsune, is located in the Forest of Spirits and consists of low, thatched buildings in an intentionally ancient, though effective, design. Rather than torches, star orbs line the streets and glow with soft foxfire to light the darkness-legends state that these star orbs can be unified to cloak Kihime in illusions and abjurations in times of peril. Angen, in the Verduran Forest of Taldor, represents a more modern and cosmopolitan kitsune town, with buildings made in a variety of styles. Angen customs emphasize unity and collectivism, one of the best known being the Foxes' Wedding. In this yearly festival, which occurs spontaneously on the first autumn day that rain falls from a blue sky, all kitsune who became betrothed in the last year are considered married. In celebration, rainbows formed from the mixed sunlight and raindrops are enhanced by kitsune illusions, becoming truly a sight to behold.\nHeading:The Lady of Foxes\nThough usually referred to with she/her pronouns, the goddess Daikitsu's nature is fluid; her gender, age, and appearance change at her whim. Kitsune's legends state that they were created when Daikitsu granted her original attendants, fox spirits known as the Nine Bright Grains, one of her own abilities: the power to dance between shapes. \n",

   "Fey",
   "Sprite"
  ],
  "description": "Sprites are diminutive, whimsical, and exuberant creatures from the fey realm known as the First World. They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic.\nWhen most people picture a fey, chances are they're thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in the First World, where they are essentially immortal, reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life eventually comes to an end. Some even meld together with others to form a more substantial body or split apart into multiple smaller fey. However, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic, leading a significant number to risk the mortal world to explore the new possibilities offered by the unusually static nature of mortal existence. These creatures mix in with other, smaller groups of Material Plane comrades, including exiles from the First World, those whose family swore pacts to mortals, and even contemplative individuals curious to enter the mortal cycle of souls.\n The first generation of Material Plane sprites were content to guard magical locations or objects, learn music, and play pranks on the unsuspecting. Panic struck when children born in the mortal world didn't form wings upon adulthood-some sprites transitioning to the mortal world likewise lost their wings after a time. Believing this to be a sign that the mortal world was too alien for them to live there, many of the initial sprite explorers returned to the safety of the First World.\n However, their wingless children exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes, but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As they came close to reaching their full strength, many of them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique, and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen before, a sign of their limitless potential.\n If you want a character who is tiny, mercurial, and curious, you should play a sprite.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Play good-natured pranks on those around you, intended to teach a lesson, aid in locating a lost item, or even help find love.\n\t- Become sidetracked by something new and eye-catching before you have fully followed through on your previous plan.\n\t- Find something magical that's so important to you, you can't help but protect it with every ounce of your strength.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Expect you to know strange fey mysteries and perform fantastical primal magic well beyond your actual abilities.\n\t- Consider you the prime suspect whenever unexplained hijinks or serendipity comes their way.\n\t- Misconstrue the way your mind works, seeing your flitting attention as a sign of being scatterbrained.\nHeading:Physical Description\nSprites are tiny faeries whose features vary wildly based on their heritage. The Wingless-those with the potential to become powerful heroes and villains, including all PC sprites-slowly grow their wings over time as their magical potential manifests, though some never grow wings at all. Those sprites with humbler destinies typically grow wings when reaching full adulthood and mastering their innate magic. Sprites reach adulthood at around the same rate as humans do, but a typical fey who can manage to stay out of mischief and danger can live 1,000 years or more. Material Plane sprites who sense their time is coming to an end usually return to the First World to be reborn and start their adventure all over again.\nHeading:Society\nSprites habitually live in tiny, reclusive villages in areas with abundant magic, natural beauty, or other curiosities of interest. Other sprites live as loners or with small family or peer groups, traveling across the land in search of excitement.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nSprites run the gamut of alignments but are rarely lawful or evil. They are far more likely to worship the Eldest- the peculiar deities of the fey-than those of the mortal world. They have a particular affinity for Shyka, the many-formed Eldest of time, and the Lantern King, the trickster among their ranks. Among mortal deities, sprites appreciate Desna the most, and due to her iconic depiction as a butterfly-winged woman, some Desnan sprites claim her as one of their own. Sprites also readily comprehend the doctrines of Cayden Cailean and Shelyn, and the goddess of beauty and art is a particular favorite among grigs.\nHeading:Adventurers\nWhile PCs sprites are marked from adulthood as destined for great things, their childhoods before that point vary as widely as any other ancestry. That said, the tendency of most sprites to live either apart from civilization or in small villages means they rarely have backgrounds related to cities or large organizations and more likely were acrobats, animal whisperers, artists, entertainers, gamblers, herbalists, hermits, nomads, or scouts. Sprites are most often bards, rogues, or sorcerers, though sprite rangers and druids do exist and tap into their love of the natural world. Likewise, sprite witches and wizards are even more enthusiastic about learning the secrets of magic, and sprite oracles approach the contradictions of their mystery from the experience of living the contradictions between the fey and mortal worlds.\nHeading:Names\nSprite names are based entirely on their parents' whimsy. Sprites often adopt additional monikers later in life or change those assigned to them at birth; this is neither frowned upon nor considered abnormal.\nHeading:Sample Names\nBree, Plumgrass, Cowrie, Flit, Moth, Zephyr, Naatalu, Pinebrush, Zandivar\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Riding PCs\nAs a Tiny creature, a sprite PC weighs so little and takes up so little Bulk that it doesn't cause issues to hitch a ride in a sack, shoulder, or other position on another PC. However, the amount of coordination required to ensure you don't get in each other's way or jostle each other into losing actions makes this tactic unfavorable for most fellow adventurers during combat. If you're riding along with another PC or similar non-minion intelligent creature, roll both your initiatives and use the lower of the two results. You act in either order on the same initiative count. While traveling in this way, you each gain two actions at the start of your turn, instead of three, since they spend one action keeping you balanced on their back, and you spend one action maintaining your grip.\nHeading:Sprites in Society\nSprites who mingle openly among mortals find that mortal superstitions about fey regularly color their interactions with sprites, for both good and ill. Mortals often believe half-remembered tales, frequently about a different sort of fey altogether; most sprites find this hilarious and play along. Mortals uninterested in sprites' pranks tend to view them as nuisances and treat them accordingly. Additionally, sprites' small stature and excitable natures sometimes cause mortals to treat them like children. Sprites vary in their reactions to this sort of treatment from annoyance to good humor, and sometimes even a realization that they can get away with more this way.\nHeading:Tiny PCs\nPCs are typically Small or Medium size, but most sprite PCs are Tiny instead! Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space and reach. Your Tiny sprite can enter another creature's space, which is important because your melee Strikes typically have no reach, meaning you must enter their space to attack them. Like other Tiny creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to Take Cover. You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a reach 5 feet shorter than normal if they have the reach trait). Remember to adjust the Bulk of items and your Bulk limit for Tiny size (see Items and Sizes).\n",

   "Strix"
  ],
  "description": "Known as itarii in their own language, strix are reclusive avian humanoids devoted to their homelands and their tribes. They defend their precious communities with broad wingspans and razor talons.\nStrix value ferocity, vengeance, and devotion above all else. Their dark, formidable wingspans and long history of taking revenge for their fallen family members have painted them as winged devils in the eyes of neighboring human populations. In contradiction to their misunderstood nature, strix boast a spiritual, artistic, and compassionate culture that is rarely seen outside of their roosts.\n As strix populations begin to resurge and spread beyond the mountainous region known as the Devil's Perch, their tribes now speckle the landscape of Cheliax and surrounding nations. Soaring over mountains, forests, and beaches, strix are always brought home by the deep connections they share with their kinfolk. If you want a character who is loyal yet enigmatic, fierce yet artistic, and who yearns to soar above the world, you should play a strix.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Dedicate and endear yourself to your family, friends, or community.\n\t- Harbor an inherited distrust of humans.\n\t- Keep strangers at arm's length and perhaps exhibit naivete about the world beyond your homeland.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Appreciate your dedicated friendship, even if they don't grasp the cultural history behind it.\n\t- Treat you on occasion like a carrier pigeon, asking you to deliver letters or other similar favors.\n\t- Find your appearance frightening due to complete inexperience with strix.\nHeading:Physical Description\nStrix are avian-influenced humanoids with intimidating talons and feathered wings sprouting from their backs. With an average height of 6 feet, strix are taller than most humans but are very light for their size. Strix are considered mature at 14 years of age and have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have pointed ears and large eyes that are typically black from sclera to pupil, but occasionally appear as a piercing golden color. Strix lack the ability to move their eyes independently of their head, resulting in distinctive jerky movements as their gaze snaps between targets. Their bodies are usually taut with defined musculature-a result of the strength necessary to flex their wings.\nHeading:Society\nStrix are rare and reclusive people who cling to their ancestral territories. They live in modest-sized tribes, but some reside in smaller bands of tight-knit individuals. The largest settlements of strix reside on Devil's Perch, but a small number of their ilk have traveled far across Golarion. Strix feel an intense empathy and attachment to their family and other community members. They prioritize the needs of their community over their individual desires, and their bands and tribes benefit from an easy yet expertly organized division of labor. Strix tribes are led by a rokoa, a female tribal leader.\n A long history of conflict with the nearby nation of Cheliax has bred into most strix a deep fear and suspicion of humans-who they call kotaara. Strix have struggled to keep hold of their territories and maintain their numbers in the face of constant conflict with these enemies who, in addition to trying to destroy what they believe to be winged devils, vastly outnumber them. Due to their strongly bonded groups, the loss of a single tribe member is devastating.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nDue to their deep respect for the rules of a functioning society, strix are rarely chaotic, but some may be flexible on adopting the rules of outside societies. Strix are typically nonreligious and instead use stories from an epic known as the Korrsat Akra, or \u201cThe Scattered Nest,\u201d to tell them of their origins and give them direction on their current place in the world. They have a deep investment in the lives of their fellows and experience intense grief at their passing.\n Pharasma is a common influence among religious strix due to the popularity of religious and spiritual practices honoring the lives and deaths in their beloved community. Gozreh is also an everyday influence for many strix, who beseech the Wind and the Waves to give them satisfying tailwinds for flight and protect their kin when the sky turns dark with fury. Erastil and even Torag represent two versions of social order and may be unifying deities across entire tribes.\nHeading:Adventurers\nAdventuring strix most commonly take the emissary, hermit, nomad, scout, or street urchin backgrounds. Strix are agile combatants and prudent adventurers who excel as druids, fighters, monks, rangers, or rogues.\nHeading:Names\nStrix names consist of sounds that are reminiscent of chirping, screeches, or trilling by various birds, and their naming conventions are influenced primarily by tradition and spirituality. Strix in small communities might share a common syllable among all their names to express their unity. Due to their deep affection for their family members, naming children after other loved ones is very common, occasionally with an additional syllable or slight change to the pronunciation.\nHeading:Sample Names\nChiit-iir, Cicreeti, Ikatarii, Irkoata, Kaata, Kiilo, Kirii, Rahka, Roatatwiil, Turiilo, Turuk, Twilii\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Rokoas\nStrix tribes are led by a spiritual, social, and military leader called a rokoa. Rokoas are elder female leaders who consult a council of other warriors and spiritualists to make decisions for the entirety of the community. Young female strix are selected early as potential successors to the tribe's current rokoa. Often the rokoa herself chooses her favorite prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to pass along her storytelling recitations, battle stratagems, and spiritual understanding.\nHeading:Strix Settlements\nStrix settlements, called roosts, are lofty dwellings at the highest point of the local landscape. Mountains are a particular favorite, especially if they provide tall spires that make foot traffic impossible. Strix living in forests build their communities around the largest trees available, and seaside dwellers prefer to nestle their dwellings along perilous cliffs.\n By far, the largest strix community resides at Ciricskree, which translates from the Strix language to \u201cthe Shrieking Spire.\u201d This tribe of over 500 individuals is the cultural epicenter for the Devil's Perch and the entire Avistani strix population. Additional settlements include the Ikaraka in the Barrowood forest at the base of the Menador Mountains, and the small Blackcove tribe along the shore, who have established a tolerant trading relationship with a nearby fishing village.\nHeading:Strix Storytelling\nStrix utilize storytelling to convey a verbal history of their people and perform poetic tales that sound like songs when sung in their native tongue. Nestling strix grow up hearing their histories sung to them as lullabies and serenades of daily life. Powerful moments are punctuated with screeches, and mournful recounts float in the air like soft cooing.

   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Azarketis, inheritors of a shattered empire's legacy, hold their proud traditions close but still surface to interact with the rest of the world.\nThe aquatic humanoids of the Inner Sea share a somber and burdened history. Most refer to these aquatic peoples as gillmen or sometimes Low Azlanti, though they typically refer to themselves as azarketi, an Azlanti word that translates roughly to \u201cpeople of the seas.\u201d After Earthfall, these proud humans were mutated into aquatic servants by their alghollthu foes. Feeling like they don't fully belong with their human brethren nor with the sea that binds them, many azarketis struggle for a sense of identity and purpose. Though they remain distrusted by the surface dwellers, azarketis celebrate their unique lineage and their descent from the venerated Azlanti culture.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Ambitiously seek to defy negative perceptions and prejudice laid against you.\n\t- Be reclusive and skeptical of strangers.\n\t- Regard the water as your home, but be intrigued by societies along the shore.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t-  Assume you are an ambassador to the sea and ask for your advice on nautical matters.\n\t- Misunderstand your gentle gestures and mild expressions.\n\t- Treat you with distrust or suspicion and anticipate betrayal from you.\nHeading:Physical Description\nAzarketis appear as regal, athletic humans. Their soft, hydrophilic skin ranges in tones from pearlescent white to pinkish, greenish, or brown tones reminiscent of coral. Azarketis with hair are somewhat rare; many sport fins or scaled ridges on their heads instead. Like the Azlanti people from which they descend, they often have violet eyes. Their aquatic lineage is obvious thanks to the sets of three gills on either side of their necks, as well as their webbed hands and feet. Azarketis have been known to live longer than humans, although they mature at about the same rate.\nHeading:Society\nAzarketis lack the center for combined culture that helps other groups maintain a cohesive identity. The vastness of the oceans and waterways spread these swift-swimming people across the Inner Sea and beyond. Many azarketis rely only on the small familial groups in their immediate community and prefer smaller populations with comrades they trust and know intimately.\n Some azarketis prefer to foster connections with their surface-dwelling brethren. Living in ports, river towns and along the shore allows azarketis a greater scope of opportunities not afforded to exclusively land or sea peoples. Although integrating with land society can be difficult, azarketis manage by forming bonded communities. Members will often have fond familial names for one another, regardless of actual relation.\n If they have the means, some azarketis dress in attire reflecting their Azlanti heritage. More commonly, azarketis do their best to remain inconspicuous when they emerge from the water. Many will wear shemaghs or other head wrappings, which both hide their gills and provide a few extra comfortable hours out of water if soaked before donning.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nAs they are typically outsiders to the domains of surface life, azarketis tend toward deities with an affinity for the ocean or other forms of water, the most popular being Gozreh. They are also likely to give reverence to other deities of nature or navigation, such as Desna.\n Some azarketis are tempted toward the call of the deep and serve their old alghollthu masters as gods. These individuals are enticed by eldritch entities such as the mysterious veiled masters-powerful beings of the deep ocean responsible for both uplifting and destroying the Azlanti people.\n Azarketis vary wildly in beliefs and values, as evidenced by their broad divergence in allegiance; thus, azarketis can be of any alignment.\nHeading:Adventurers\nWith their affinity to water, nautical navigation skills, and athletic capabilities, azarketis make ideal rangers. Azarketis' versatility both on land and in water make them particularly formidable fighters, while their direct connection to the sea leads many others to become druids. As many azarketis have a connection to alghollthus' occult magic, it's not uncommon for azarketis to be sorcerers, though studious individuals sometimes become bards or wizards instead.\nHeading:Names\nAzarketis often take the names of nautical, weather, or geographical features important to the azarketi's family. Other azarketi groups will choose human names in order to encourage conformity with surface cultures. Some azarketi names have been passed down through so many generations that they still use ancient Azlanti roots or refer to bodies of water that no longer exist.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAft, Aliz, Cascade, Delta, Harbor, Ilani, Inkua, Jib, Lagoon, Lobay, Marine, Tidal, Windward, Zarket\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:A Place Undersea\nDue to their association with the alghollthu, azarketi often face discrimination on the surface. Below, however, they are just another ocean denizen. Many revel in the isolation from their human ancestors, finding true peace in the depths.\nHeading:Alghollthus\nAzarketis have a complex relationship with alghollthus, who saved but then enslaved their people. Alvadnas have the greatest chance of meeting an alghollthu face to face. Azarketi sentiments toward these creatures vary: some fight fiercely against their ancient enemies; others bargain for power or safety, or even serve through compulsion.\nHeading:Azarketi Enclaves\nAzarketis are mostly concentrated around the Inner Sea region. The Isle of Kortos hosts several pockets of azarketi settlements, helped by the presence of the azarketi city Kienek-Li to the north of Starstone Isle. Gilltown is the largest azarketi community in Absalom, but azarketis are also prevalent in the city's seaside districts.\nHeading:Azarketi Types\nSome azarketis live near the ruins of Old Azlant or in the deepest trenches of the ocean and lead isolated and mysterious lives. River azarketis settle at the bases of waterfalls, or hidden away in the caves behind them. Small nomadic azarketi groups have taken to land in rainy or marshy locations, though such groups are rare.\nHeading:Fighting Spirit\nSurface azarketis often keep to the margins of human society, working menial jobs or filling roles that allow them isolation when necessary. Many consequently have a chip on their shoulder and are only too eager to prove themselves in the face of skeptics. Such azarketis often take up the life of a mercenary or adventurer.\nHeading:Legacy of Azlant\nDirectly descended from the people of Azlant, azarketis have preserved their ancestors' culture through art, oral traditions, songs, and stories. Azarketi scholars study the history of Azlant and Earthfall, elders recite tales of Azlanti legends, and musicians sing songs to long-lost gods. Most azarketis know the location of the nearest Azlanti ruin, and many possess a piece of Azlanti jewelry.\nHeading:Other Sea Creatures\nAzarketis are one of many ancestries to live beneath the water's surface. They have the most contact with locathahs, humanoid fish-folk with an easygoing, friendly demeanor. Azarketis find merfolk territorial neighbors, though their shared private tendencies lead to mostly amicable relations. Together they combat their shared enemies, the monstrous but intelligent sahuagins.\n",

   "Anadi",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Anadi people are reclusive, sapient spiders who hail from the jungles of southern Garund. Though they act in many ways like natural-born shapeshifters, their twin forms actually stem from carefully developed magic.\nAs a communal and peaceful people, anadi ancestors endeavored to establish trade with the neighbors of their homeland. However, these anadi soon learned that most others found their appearance to be extremely objectionable. Wishing to avoid conflict, ancient anadi retreated into isolation until they could find a solution. The answer came when their greatest scholars innovated a fusion of transmutation and illusion magic that allowed them to assume a humanoid form. The technique was developed, perfected, and eventually taught to the overwhelming majority of anadi.\n Early efforts with their new approach to diplomacy have yielded much better results, though sporadic contact means that some outsiders whisper false legends about anadi, such as claims that they are humans who transform into monstrous spiders at moonrise. Even contemporary explorers have reported anadi as human-spider hybrids. The anadi people of the current day strive to slowly but surely create a world where they no longer need to hide their true nature.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Only reveal your true form to people who have earned your trust.\n\t- Openly express sympathy for misrepresented and unfairly stigmatized cultures.\n\t- Provide for those you hold dear and defend them from danger without hesitation.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Appreciate your willingness to seek nonviolent solutions to complicated problems.\n\t- Have a strong reaction to seeing your natural form.\n\t- Assume you have an affinity for druidic magic, given your ability to transform.\nHeading:Physical Description\nAnadi in their true form resemble human-sized spiders with a variety of colorations. Some tones look simple or muted while other remain striking and vibrant, with most patterns inherited from an anadi's parentage. A typical anadi measures five feet in length from their front legs to their rear legs when standing comfortably.\n All anadi possesses the ability to transform into a human guise. This form can resemble any human ethnicity, but it's usually one that blends in with the region of an anadi's hatching. Anadi reach physical maturity after 13 years, going through multiple phases of molting along the way. A typical anadi lives to be about 80 years old.\nHeading:Society\nAnadi live in a communal society, sharing peaceful lives farming mushrooms or weaving warm blankets. Their culture places great value on cooperation and mutual respect. Due to this cultural upbringing, anadi often have issues facing severe conflict and often come off to other ancestries as very shy. Their history of dealing with arachnophobia in other peoples-which anadi understand is often instinctual and very difficult to control-likewise means that anadi do their best to be accommodating and comforting, even in situations that aren't necessarily fair to them.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nThe cooperative nature of anadi society and their dislike of violence means many anadi lean toward good alignments. They're more often neutral than chaotic or lawful, though the latter aren't unheard of.  Legends say Grandmother Spider rescued anadi people from servitude and brought them to Golarion, becoming their patron deity in the process. Her values of mutual care and playful trickery interweave into anadi culture, and even those who don't worship her tell tales of her adventures.\nHeading:Adventurers\nAnadi who answer the call to adventure often do so to learn more about the world at large. Common anadi backgrounds include artisan, emissary, herbalist, hunter, and scholar. Anadi adventurers who want to support their communities often become clerics or druids. Rogue remains a popular choice among those who seek to hide their true form. Anadi who wish to continue their magical traditions tend to become wizards or sorcerers.\nHeading:Names\nAnadi names are given by the members of the web marriage that raised them. Each parent contributes a single syllable, usually the first, from their own name. Older anadi who feel their identity has settled often take on or are given a phrase-title to honor them as well. Anadi who live among human populations rarely take a cover name, but some might adopt one if their given name strongly contrasts the norm in the local culture.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAltava, Anavachti, Strings-On-The-River Inkeelah, Kerialnamu, Maracha, Leaves-Shelter-Her-Feet Naiala, Orvasa, Reloana, Rivuken, Velachamon\n",

  "description": "Conrasus are shards of cosmic force given consciousness who construct intricate exoskeletons to interface with the mortal world. Both an integral part of the underlying processes of the universe and strangely set apart, conrasus look to aeons to understand their existence.\nConrasus aren't entirely clear on their own origins. Some historians think them a failed experiment of a wizardly cabal-possibly a splinter of artificers from the ancient Jitska Imperium-who desperately hoped to bind a pleroma to bolster their army but who accidentally conjured shattered scraps of the aeon instead. Others believe conrasus were built by their ancestors using an accelerated, iterative evolution process as natural as one designed by those who build portions of their own bodies could ever hope to achieve. Most likely, it is a mix of the two.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Do your best to determine and act upon the will of your guiding aeon.\n\t- Use rituals and repetitive actions as a means to meditate and reflect on your purpose.\n\t- Have difficulty applying your cosmic instincts and senses to a physical existence.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- View you as part of a hivemind at best or lacking in free will at worst.\n\t- Have trouble understanding your perspective or attempts at communication.\n\t- Look to you as the expert on any matters involving aeons or related beings.\nHeading:Physical Description\nThe true form of a conrasu is an abstract chunk of spiritual essence. While their being exists beyond the truth of humanoid senses, to the mortal eye, their body usually resembles a globe of light, darkness, or space. Floating, internal pinpricks of illumination sit inside the ball, slightly obscured as if peeking through a gelatinous substance. These \u201ccores\u201d surround themselves with bodies made out of still-living wood, creating the form that most people recognize as a conrasu. Conrasus themselves are called to a path and, once they find it, shape frames to create a suitable form, leading to a wide variety of appearances.\n As a conrasu ages, the supple green wood of their body hardens, causing their limbs to lose mobility. Conrasus must constantly grow new arms and roots for their living exoskeleton, leaving their frozen limbs as immobile effigies along their shell.\n Conrasus can't maintain their integrity without their wooden exoskeletons. A conrasu that loses its exoskeleton dissipates and dies, though they can be returned to life with magic like other beings.\nHeading:Society\nThere are three distinct types of conrasus. Maintainers tend and care for others, believing they must cultivate a proper balance between various forces. Shapers build and direct those around them, and feel that balance is maintained by those who strive to preserve the world's equilibrium. Lastly, correctors fix problems of all sorts, often acting as stalwart bastions of law who  perceive the world in absolutes, with few to no shades of gray. True balance can be achieved only in cases where pressure and force have been applied to make necessary changes.\n On rare occasions, a conrasu may hear and heed the call of another form of extraplanar being. One might serve a psychopomp, another an archon, and yet another might become a witch and adopt an unknown figure as a patron.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMany conrasus consider themselves bound to a specific aeon, following them like a deity and doing what they believe to be the aeon's bidding. As a result, almost all conrasus are lawful neutral in alignment.\nHeading:Adventurers\nMaintainers who become adventurers are often wizards, bards, or clerics who offer their magic and knowledge to the group and subtly nudge the party as needed. Correctors tend to become champions, clerics, and fighters, forming heavy and hard living wood armor around themselves to keep them safe from harm. The rare shaper might travel with a group as a druid or even a bard, usually to accomplish a goal they believe lies outside of the enclaves.\n No matter the path a conrasu finds themselves on, they tend to come from similar backgrounds. Field medic and herbalist tend to fit those who find themselves comfortable in their homes and with those of their nursery while conrasus of nomad or emissary backgrounds tend to enjoy roaming from place to place.\nHeading:Names\nConrasus have little in the way of consciousness as others understand it before they self-actualize and leave the nursery-towns where they sprouted. That includes a name, a concept of gender, and even the passage of time beyond their little bubbles-these are picked up in the wider world. As a result, a conrasu might have nearly any appellation.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAutoma, Azubu, Dumi, Emeka, Ganizadi, Locu, Incanes, Radi, Shell, Weave \n",

   "Gnoll",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Powerfully-built humanoids that resemble hyenas, gnolls are cunning warriors and hunters. Their frightening visage and efficient tactics have given them an ill-starred reputation.\nIn lands to the east, such as Katapesh, gnolls have earned themselves well-deserved reputations as brutal slavers and demon-worshippers. Even in the Mwangi Expanse, many outsiders believe that gnolls are witches, cannibals, and worse. The truth is more complex.\n Mwangi gnolls, known to themselves as \u201ckholo,\u201d are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders. To gnolls, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any loss of a gnoll affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it's mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Gnolls see effectiveness as a cardinal virtue and believe that the best fight is one that never gives the opponent a chance to strike back. Mwangi gnolls are masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare-none of which endears them to their neighbors.\n Equally misunderstood is the gnoll practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism. Gnolls consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a grand feast and transforming the bones of the fallen into art or weapons. Gnolls extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring their enemy's cunning or strength into the clan. While it's a sign of admiration, not everyone sees it that way.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Always try to work smarter, not harder.\n\t- Be very physically demonstrative-often hugging, punching, or licking your friends.\n\t- Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.\n\t- Assume that you are dishonorable or worse.\n\t- Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.\nHeading:Physical Description\nGnolls are large, hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles, sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, rougher on the back and softer and lighter on the stomach and throat, usually in an off-white, tan, or brown shade-spots and stripes are both common. Gnolls typically stand between six and seven feet tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men, and correspondingly stronger. Gnolls are considered adults at fifteen, and live about 60 years on average, though some can reach a hundred or more in good health.\nHeading:Society\nKholo generally live in clans of 10 to 20 interrelated family groups, containing between 100 to 200 gnolls. They are ruled by a council of female gnolls, typically selected from the oldest members of each family. This council of elders selects one of their number as a Chief Elder, who is essentially the first among equals and sets the agenda. The council is advised by the clan's bonekeeper and storyteller, as well as one or more younger gnolls who lead hunting and raiding packs.\n Bonekeepers focus on tending to the wishes of gnoll ancestors and gods- they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon their clothing and homes. Storytellers serve as teachers and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything else relevant to the clan. They usually speak several languages.\n Kholo women typically work as hunters, warriors, and leaders, while men become artisans, caretakers, and gatherers. However, adherence to gender roles varies from clan to clan. Members of either gender can become bonekeepers or storytellers, and these positions often routes to authority for male gnolls.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMwangi gnolls have an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to life, and prioritize results over methods. They are usually loyal and generous to their people and ruthless toward outsiders-gnolls are typically chaotic neutral but can skew good or evil depending on who they view as \u201ctheir people.\u201d\n Gnolls appeal to their ancestors on a day-to-day basis, invoking their kin to bless cubs, ward off disease, or grant luck on hunts. Gnolls call upon the gods on special occasions or in times of great crisis. Most kholo give homage to Calistria and Shelyn as the Elder and Younger Sisters, twin goddesses of power and beauty. Nethys, the Brother, is the patron of bonekeepers, and Lamashtu, while a popular deity in other gnoll societies, is propitiated as the Old Mother, a goddess called upon only as a very last resort, and otherwise begged to stay away.\nHeading:Adventurers\nSome gnolls leave their clans to work as mercenaries and adventurers, learning new skills, earning wealth, and gaining allies that will one day benefit their people. Other adventuring gnolls are without clans, left orphaned by some disaster or exiled, fairly or not, for some crime. All gnolls are strongly pack-minded and tend to adopt their friends as honorary gnolls and packmates.\n Gnolls usually hail from the animal whisperer, entertainer, herbalist, hunter, nomad, scout, and warrior backgrounds. The ranger is the archetypal gnoll class, a cunning warrior of the wilderness, but gnolls also make excellent barbarians and fighters, and their love of clever tricks make them outstanding rogues. Bonekeepers are usually witches, treating ancestral spirits more like squabbling colleagues than objects of worship, while storytellers are typically bards.\nHeading:Names\nNewborn kholo are given a root name, typically that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as this is considered narcissistic and arrogant). As a gnoll reaches certain milestones in life, they add descriptors to their name. Root names are often passed down through families, while descriptors are chosen to fit the gnoll's personality, usually in raucous ceremonies.\nHeading:Sample Names\nBaobab, Jackal, Onyx Elephant in Shadows, Red Thorn, Unbent Iron Reed, White Acacia, Wistful Tooth, Woodpecker\n",

   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Golomas fear most other people and deliberately use their unusual biology to frighten off those they consider to be dangerous predators. Rarely seen and poorly understood, golomas' many-eyed and wooden faced visages instill terror in most they meet.\nThough just as capable of being dangerous as any intelligent creature on Golarion, golomas have a deep-rooted psychological understanding that they are prey, and that all two-eyed people are predators. As a result, golomas rarely reveal themselves to others, and when they do, they often adopt threatening personas as a means to protect themselves. Even those few golomas who venture out into greater Mwangi society often have trouble relating to other ancestries, due to their strong differences in perception and mindset.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Instinctively process large amounts of disparate information quickly and efficiently.\n\t- Project an air of intimidation to conceal your nervous disposition.\n\t- Have difficulty distinguishing individual objects or people from others that are similar.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Are frightened by your strange physiology.\n\t- Mistake your difficulties with identifying distinct people from one another as indifference.\n\t- Are awed by your skill at noticing minute details at a glance and drawing rapid conclusions.\nHeading:Physical Description\nGolomas are humanoids with rough skin that ranges in color from warm brown to ebony, although sickly gray or white individuals with albinism are not uncommon. Their fingers and feet are coated with a thin layer of chitin. A goloma's face is an oblong wedge made of smooth chitin, almost resembling a wooden mask. Protruding from this face are eight gelatinous, shining eyes. A goloma's mouth and jaw are located beneath their face-plate, and a bony crest juts from the top of their chitinous visage. The back of a goloma's head and neck is coated in black hair that is filled with thousands of tiny, peering eyes. These eyes tend to glow and squirm as they look around-an unsettling sight for most.\nHeading:Society\nAn ancient goloma story states that during a calamity unleashed long ago, gods and demons burst forth from the earth to steal the eyes from other creatures. Only the golomas and others who were in hiding were spared-yet golomas soon began to be hunted by the now two-eyed people, who were hungry to take goloma eyes to replace what they had lost. This accurately sums up most golomas' mentalities: to be exposed is to be vulnerable, and to trust a stranger is deadly. Golomas usually travel and live with groups of other golomas, as this is where they feel most comfortable. \n Golomas learn at a young age to be vigilant at all times, observing the environment for any irregularities and then reacting with quick, calculated instinct rather than deliberative action. Other ancestries often perceive golomas to be paranoid and hypervigilant. Golomas are also better at wide-scale observation than observation of specific things-they can easily notice commonalities across large fields but have difficulty remembering what a specific object or creature looked like. This only increases their paranoia, as they have trouble visually distinguishing known friends from potentially hostile foes.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nGolomas tend to focus on their own survival and thus are typically neutral, though those who find more comfort in conformity than others trend toward lawful alignments. Golomas often pay homage to Kalekot, a deity of protective fear, as the guardian of their people, though not one to be trusted. Kalekot is called upon to curse those who victimize golomas, as most feel that justice can only be attained using supernatural means. Other popular gods include Mazludeh and Grandmother Spider, who encourage the strength of community, though a typical goloma's idea of community is often very insular.\nHeading:Adventurers\nGolomas keep to themselves in self-sufficient societies, and commonly possess backgrounds such as hunter, laborer, artist, or farmhand. Golomas who keep a lookout for their communities might be scouts or acolytes. They make excellent clerics of more unusual gods-those who are less attuned to a typical humanoid mindset and seek worshippers who can truly understand them. Druids are not uncommon among golomas, and they also make excellent investigators.\nHeading:Names\nA goloma's true name is kept among golomas, as there are hundreds of cautionary tales of what could happen if another creature learns a goloma's true name. Names tend to lack soft syllables, which golomas often struggle to pronounce, and typically consist of hard consonants and individually enunciated vowels instead. Among other people, golomas tend to use names that are intended to be intimidating, taking elements and sounds from Aklo, Necril, or words from local languages that seem to cause strong reactions.\nHeading:Sample Names\nBiqkuul, Ehbouja, Haamaah, Kouzo, Quaerjii, Tebaazu, Uruueda, Zekuukeu\n",

  "description": "Gripplis are a shy and cautious people who generally seek to avoid being drawn into the complicated and dangerous affairs of others. Despite their outlook and small stature, gripplis often take bold and noble action when the situation demands it.\nReclusive and canny, gripplis are treetop survivalists who harvest their homes' bounty and defend themselves against terrible threats. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools has led to gripplis being mischaracterized as primitive, yet this overlooks their shaping of the land with hidden orchards and camouflaged causeways that allow gripplis to live in prosperous peace. Gripplis are most likely to emerge from their forest homes to trade, explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Seek out clever ways to exploit your environment when overcoming challenges.\n\t- Make friends slowly, concerned by cautionary tales of exploitative strangers.\n\t- Be fiercely protective of your home or community.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you dislike cities and people who live in them.\n\t- Trust in your impartial, measured approach to understanding situations and solving problems.\n\t- Give you space, fearing that touching you would prove toxic.\nHeading:Physical Description\nGripplis resemble humanoid tree frogs, with oversized eyes, wide mouths, and gangly physiques. Their slight frames and large toes afford excellent grip while climbing, while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage that varies by their home environment- green and brown for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian communities, and many other colors between. A grippli grows quickly, reaching adult size of about 2 feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they're only considered adults around age 12. Gripplis rarely live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals occasionally live as long as a century.\nHeading:Society\nGripplis lead a sophisticated hunter-gatherer lifestyle with which they reshape the landscape to suit their needs: building spillways to trap fish, seeding fruit-bearing trees, sowing cover-granting foliage for future hunts, and more techniques that often escape an agriculturist's eye. These strategies rely on community cooperation as well as dispersed populations, so gripplis commonly live in small villages, each part of a complex web of alliances and relationships. Reclusiveness has preserved grippli lives and lifestyles for millennia, yet they increasingly find themselves threatened by ancient evils and new explorers alike.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nTaught to wait, observe, and respect natural processes of life and death, many gripplis adopt neutral alignments. Those who take a more active role suppressing evils that take refuge in the jungles are often neutral good, most notably those rare fiend-keepers who absorb an evil being into their soul to contain and eventually transform its villainy through virtuous acts. Nature deities such as Gozreh or Erastil often earn gripplis' respect, yet communities often prefer less prominent, more intimate divinities such as empyreal lords, psychopomp ushers, or the fey Eldest.\nHeading:Adventurers\nFor the many gripplis who hail from remote regions, wilderness backgrounds like hunter, nomad, or scout are excellent fits. Those more accustomed to urban areas might be animal whisperers, bounty hunters, and herbalists. Hermits are common, and emissaries are critical to maintaining relationships with other peoples. Thanks to their deep cultural connections to nature, gripplis make excellent druids and rangers. Their musical traditions are a great fit for bards. Gripplis' natural agility and perceptiveness also make them capable clerics, monks, and rogues.\nHeading:Names\nGrippli names often include resonant vowels and chirped consonants that remain difficult for non-gripplis to vocalize properly. Gripplis that travel widely often adopt one or more names more easily replicated by their associates.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAalpo'ol, Bogwynne, Ctaprak, Eegru, Gpoun, Gruoksh, Hrrauti, Iopo, Iykiki, Kyrsiik, Mhruugu, Oplugo, Quaasol, Yolkuu, Ztaal\n",

Their fascination with collecting and protecting esoteric knowledge is one of the few things that can persuade them to explore the outside world.\nShisks rarely encounter other peoples, even in the Mwangi Expanse. Shisks subsist on low-calorie diets of vegetables and insects, causing them to rarely compete with others for resources or seek out people to trade. They have a tight-knit society, wary of outsiders, though they don't outright attack visitors.\n Their history is passed down verbally and musically, and they rarely maintain written records in order to keep their knowledge safe.

A shisk's eyes contract into slits in the sunlight and are typically warmly colored, from hazel and brown to more unique colors like red or amber. Shisks have two prominent narrow fangs as the front teeth on their upper jaw, causing some people to mistake them for asanbosams or vampires.\nHeading:Society\nThough rarely encountered, shisks are willing to speak, host, and trade with outsiders. Their economy might be confusing to others: they greatly eschew materialism in favor of information and the arts. They freely give away material goods for knowledge or even performances, considering themselves on the \u201cwinning\u201d side of a bargain if people are willing to take material things in exchange for valuable information. They never give away information for material goods, only for other knowledge, and they rarely ask for material goods in trades.\n Shisk are so paranoid that different communities of shisks have been known to clash with one another over secrets. Wars are fought not over territory or resources, but over coveted information. On a few occasions, when shisk sages or diplomats convinced different groups of shisks to put aside their differences and collaborate, great puzzles and mysteries of Golarion have been solved in a matter of hours. \n Shisk clothing is loose and breathable, and often minimal to avoid catching on their bony feathers. Due to their society's disregard for materialism, the shisk live in great harmony with nature around them, taking only what they need. Shisk often take up simple hobbies, such as sunbathing.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nSeeing themselves as part of the natural world and typically focused on their own pursuits instead of society, most shisks adopt neutral alignments. Some shisks are patrons of gods that have been long forgotten. Many shisks worship the sun god Chohar, a fact which might seem odd for people who dwell underground. The Green Faith is highly common among shisks, but when seeking out personal gods to revere, most shisks prefer gods of knowledge and secrets such as Irez, Nethys, or Norgorber.\nHeading:Adventurers\nWith a cultural obsession around learning and secrets, shisks are perfect fits for the scholar background. They are also reclusive in their tasks, making hermits and nomads common. Their love of histories spread through song makes them ideal entertainers, while shisks' coexistence with nature means they are ideal herbalists and animal whisperers. Shisks make excellent bards and wizards, as they excel at focus and long hours of research. Those who venture into other societies to learn are also great fits for the investigator class.\nHeading:Names\nShisk names are usually granted by their parents, though these names often have secret meanings known only to their families. They are often filled with sibilant syllables, occasionally punctuated by sharp vowels.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAdomssha, Asjossa, Chishinsa, Dalissho, Lessia, Lishassha, Somissu, Quinshu\n",

  "description": "These intelligent constructs house actual souls and represent what remains of a dying empire's last attempt at greatness. Automatons combine technological ingenuity with magical power, creating a blended being wholly unique to Golarion.\nThe Jistka Imperium was the first major human civilization to emerge after Earthfall, arising around the area that would later become Rahadoum and enduring for seven centuries thanks to great advancements in civics and the sciences. However, Jistka's leaders often favored aggressive uses of technology, and early advances paved the way for arrogance, petty infighting, and corruption. The Jistka Imperium's expansionist tendencies and lack of diplomacy earned the Imperium many enemies over the course of its existence. The most notable of these foes was the empire of Ancient Osirion. Osirion's enmity ultimately sealed the Imperium's fate, as they employed clever and depraved magic that proved more than a match for Jistka's legendary golem army, even when the Jistkans began to cut corners and bind fiends into their golems. In a desperate attempt to fight back against internal corruption and external pressures, a cabal of concerned Jistkans formed the Artificer Conclave to develop new technologies to stave off the Imperium's collapse and return Jistka to its former glory. The most successful of these developments were automatons, which the Conclave believed to be the pinnacle of Jistkan constructs-or at least, the last hope for Jistka's salvation. Conclave creators transplanted the mind, life force, and soul of Jistkan individuals into these constructs, creating magical and technological marvels powered by the life energy of the greatest warriors and scholars the organization could recruit. Unfortunately, despite the Conclave's best efforts, the automatons' arrival happened too late to save the already doomed Imperium. The empire collapsed, leaving automatons to fend for themselves.\n The exceptional and forward-thinking construction of automatons means that a fair number remain today, millennia later, scattered to the winds. However, the passage of time has revealed one of automatons' greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches. Only the strongest willed have managed to retain their memories, sense of self, and lucidity after all this time. As each automaton remains as unique as any living person on Golarion; a given automaton has their own personality, shaped by countless experiences. Most automatons behave reclusively, preferring to avoid others due to fear of attachment or misunderstanding. Even automatons who are more willing to live in the open understand that their unique nature makes them a prime target for hunters, scholars, or worse. Rare is the automaton that lives without the regular occurrence of distrust or worry.\n If you want to play a character who is a living construct with powerful potential and ties to ancient magic, you should play an automaton.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Have lived for several centuries and through many significant events.\n\t- Be hesitant to trust others until they've earned it.\n\t- Remember little of your life before becoming an automaton.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Mistake you for a mindless construct when they first see you.\n\t- Assume you have secret knowledge about magic and technology.\n\t- Look upon you with awe.\nHeading:Physical Description\nAutomatons share a common construction-a blend of magically treated metals and stone. This design allows automatons to withstand the rigors of direct combat and makes them particularly hardy. Their heavy bodies can move just as quickly as other combatants, making automatons intimidating foes. The design of an automaton varies depending on the needs of its role. Most automatons have a basic humanoid shape, though some instead have shapes that closely resemble animals. The majority of automatons have a single eye that glows with a dim, magical light. Each also contains a powerful artifact that both houses its individual soul and uses a combination of life and planar energy for power. These automaton cores are marvels of magical engineering whose method of creation has been lost to time.\n As constructs, automatons typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of an automaton needs to vent an imperceivable magical exhaust at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of exhaust that can clog the automaton's systems, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, automatons can still suffocate much like living creatures. Though they don't sleep, automatons require a period of magical recalibration and restoration which stabilizes the energies within their core. Without this process, an automaton core is incapable of fully powering the automaton and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).\n Automatons don't age and the design of their cores grants them a seemingly endless power source. Many automatons that exist today are thousands of years old, their bodies as efficient as the day of their creation, even if their minds might have deteriorated with the strain of the ages. Automatons lost over time typically met violent ends. An automaton's body is just as vulnerable to destruction as any other construct, though destroying an automaton core is more difficult. As such, an automaton's soul might remain trapped within its core for years after the destruction of its body. This was the intent of the original creators, who hoped to provide functional immortality. However, in reality, the destruction of the body more often leads to a malfunction, requiring magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore the automaton completely. In the case of the core's destruction, or if it malfunctions catastrophically enough that it can no longer hold the soul, the core releases the spirit to the River of Souls.\n In some cases, an automaton can learn how to consciously or subconsciously influence its core. These automatons eventually learn how to release their souls from their cores, allowing their souls to move on when they feel they have achieved a satisfying life. This act leaves the automaton as a mindless construct, typically still active but no longer capable of anything but aimless wandering and occasional acts of self-defense.\nHeading:Society\nDue to the disparate fates of automatons, many of them lead solitary lives. There are a few cases of automatons originally designed to work together, such as groups of warriors, who remain as a team and dwell together in hideouts or travel together as wanderers. These groups are few and far between, however, and automaton settlements are even rarer. The only pockets of automatons that begin to resemble settlements typically hide among the ruins of Jistka. These groups can hold dozens of automatons, but any attempts to contact or visit them tend to be fruitless. Such gatherings are especially secretive, and the resident automatons will protect their homes at any cost.\n Automatons are far more likely to encounter other ancestries. Depending on the automaton's personality, this encounter could go a number of ways, ranging from extreme secrecy to open visitation. An automaton's unique appearance makes them stand out regardless of where they're found, but most others look upon them with awe or curiosity rather than fear. Magical constructs aren't an alien concept across Golarion, but many of them are mindless. After making it past the initial shock of a thinking construct, it's often not difficult for most grasp how to engage with an automaton. However, automatons are more likely to find the semblance of an everyday life in large cities like Absalom, Azir, or Quantium. Regardless of where they go, an automaton must remain on the lookout for those who would attempt to take their body for study or to access their core.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nThe people of the Jistka Imperium saw the aeons of Axis as ideal beings whose behavior was worthy of emulation, so many Jistkans were lawful neutral. Since many automatons contain Jistkan souls, most automatons are lawful neutral, or at least lawful in some capacity. Over the centuries, however, a fair number of automatons have drifted toward neutral alignments as their outlooks change without a primary society or set of ideals upon which to cling. Automatons tend to worship gods of technology or magic like Brigh and Nethys, or various monitor demigods. Worship of Irori and Pharasma are somewhat common among automatons as well. Pharasmin automatons likely learn how to release their souls from their cores, and often choose to do so. Though they are ancient beings from long before the time of Casandalee, a small number of automatons have recognized the new artificial goddess as a kindred spirit.\nHeading:Adventurers\nMany who became automatons had some role in society prior to their transformation and often gravitate toward classes that best represent these roles, even if they no longer remember their former life as more than subconscious flashes. Hunter, sharpshooter, and warrior automatons usually become fighters, rangers, and rogues. Spell casting classes, such as bards, witches, and wizards are common among mage automatons. While an automaton can have any background, the pool of individuals chosen to become automatons were typically of the acolyte, bounty hunter, emissary, gladiator, guard, herbalist, hunter, martial disciple, scholar, scout, or warrior background.\nHeading:Names\nAn automaton typically keeps the name they had before their transformation into a construct, if they can remember it. Even when other memories fade, memory of their name often remains. As such, many automatons have names with Jistkan origins. Second most common are automatons who had to give themselves a new name, as they lost their memories of the old one at some point. Those automatons that particularly believed in the cause of the Artificer Conclave might instead take the name of one of the conclave's members in honor of the cause that they gave their body to support. Some automatons prefer to change their names over their lifetimes, either selecting a new name from a culture they encountered or adding a title to represent a significant moment in their lives. In some cases an automaton will use a particularly cherished title in place of any other name.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAlnhaman, Busmin, The Doleful, Enoh, Himar, Kantral, The Kindred, Numinar, Scholar, Tehkis, Wayfarer, Yulmian\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Automaton Origins\nThe method of creating automatons as the Artificer Conclave did millennia ago has been lost to time. As such, most automatons who remain on Golarion were created during Jistka's existence. However, there are a few rare automatons that have different origins. Anquira, herself an automaton and a high-ranking member of the Artificer Conclave, resides in Axis and seems to be nearing the point of recreating the Jistkan process. She's created a few promising prototype automatons with her techniques. There are also rumors of another automaton doing similar research somewhere in the deserts of the Golden Road, though the new automatons emerging from the desert appear somewhat incomplete.\n Of significant note are the increased reports of automatons in southern Garund, originating from the nation of Eihlona. The nation is famous for its inhabitants' skill in mixing magic with technology, particularly the remnants of Shory technology that crashed within the nation's borders in ages past. Eihlonan mage crafters have managed to recreate automatons using their vast knowledge, magical prowess, and access to ancient technology, alongside insights from a few friendly automaton immigrants who found a respectful and welcoming home there. Though the process is long and arduous, Eihlona seems to be on the verge of recreating the success of the Artificer Conclave. If they do, they could someday produce hundreds, if not thousands of automatons.\nHeading:Enhancements\nAutomatons are built to receive enhancements and modifications to their bodies. Many automaton ancestry feats have an \u201cEnhancement\u201d line that represents a possible augmentation you can acquire. You don't gain the benefits of the enhancement unless you take a feat that grants you those benefits, such as Lesser Augmentation. You can only gain the enhancements of a given feat once.\nHeading:Versatile Heritages\nSince automatons have artificial bodies, they don't manifest the features of versatile heritages, even if the soul within their core did so in life. As a result, most automatons don't have a versatile heritage. However, players who are interested in taking a versatile heritage are encouraged to speak with their GM to best determine an explanation for the versatile heritage. Since an automaton core draws on planar energy, there is a chance that said energy manifests in a versatile heritage, such as a tiefling automaton with an overabundance of Hell's planar energy. Alternatively, a powerful soul might still be able to manifest the features of their heritage they had prior to transfer to an automaton body. An automaton with a versatile heritage will have minimal physical changes if any, though the color of energy that courses through their core and the rest of their body might change to properly represent the versatile heritage.\n",

  "trait": [
   "Construct",
   "Humanoid"
  ],
  "description": "Poppets are small, basic constructs that typically help their owners with simple tasks. Occasionally, poppets gain sapience, independence, and a spark of life. Elevated beyond mere helpers or playthings, these poppets are free to chart their own destinies.\nMost commonly made of cloth, wicker, and wood, poppets are among the simplest of constructs. They serve as helpers to fetch tools, clean dishes, tidy rooms, or perform other light tasks. Their size and appearance vary, but nearly all poppets appear humanoid in shape and between 1 to 3 feet tall. They're usually roughly made with button eyes sewn onto blank faces, strings of yarn in place of hair, and a simple dress or tunic made from coarse, cheap cloth. Wealthy families sometimes purchase poppets as toys, with their squishy bodies and stitched smiles, to keep their children company. Most poppets can't speak and lack the intellect to understand speech beyond preprogrammed orders. Poppets can become familiars, as presented here.\n Very, very rarely, a common poppet spontaneously manifests a spark of life-a tiny bit of life essence- and becomes a thinking, independent creature. These events are exceedingly rare; fewer than one in a thousand gain this spark. A poppet might manifest this life essence through a magical fluke in its construction, a brush with ephemeral spirits, or even the fervent wish of a loving child. Whatever their origin, the poppets described here as an ancestry have their own life and free will. They might consider their creators or former owners to be friends, but they acknowledge no one as their master and often leave comfortable homes or workshops to seek their place in the world.\n Sapient living poppets usually refer to themselves as \u201cawakened\u201d to indicate the moment they gained clear and true self-awareness. Poppets might talk about this event as the time they \u201cpopped up,\u201d \u201cwoke up,\u201d or \u201csparked alive.\u201d Most poppets celebrate two special anniversaries each year: the day of their initial creation (which, for most poppets, they must learn secondhand or by studying their creator's records) and the day they awoke to true consciousness.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Like surprising others with your unexpected cleverness and eloquence.\n\t- Seek out other self-aware beings that most people might overlook.\n\t- Rely on your harmless appearance to trick others.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Mistake you for a toy.\n\t- Doubt your ability to handle tasks that require any dexterity or complex thought.\n\t- Wonder whether your mundane form conceals other magical marvels.\nHeading:Physical Description\nLiving poppets are both humanoids and constructs, which gives them some of the benefits and drawbacks of each category. Their bodies are usually made of wood and wicker, but they can be made of cloth, leather, tin, stuffing, or delicate clockwork. Either way, poppets burn or melt quickly and must take care to avoid fire. They virtually never look alike, as each is created from unique and unusual circumstances.\n Poppets are fully alert and self-aware when they awaken to sentience; although they might not know much at first, they instantly gain intelligence and consciousness. They must breathe and sleep, and they must consume food and water each day; through a sort of magical digestion they can restore rips, tears, or scuffs in their physical form. Poppets don't age the same way fleshy creatures do, but they slowly wear down in physical form as well as in mental acuity. A poppet that tends to their body and mind (and takes care to avoid fire) can live up to 30 years.\nHeading:Society\nFree-willed poppets are so rare that almost no such poppet has met another. Poppets normally live with larger creatures, though not always their creators, and tend to get along well in societies sized for larger creatures. Most live in cities because that's where toy makers, clockwork crafters, and other specialists have their shops, but poppets created by lonely hermits or reclusive inventors might prefer a life in the wilderness.\n Poppets often stay on the lookout for other creatures who, like them, have stumbled into self-awareness. They might have regular conversations with animated objects, golems, houseplants, statues, or toys, in which they're deeply polite out of a desire to leave a good impression for the time when the object \u201cwakes up.\u201d\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nOrdinary poppets are built as helpers and companions, and awakened poppets tend to retain this drive to aid others. They're therefore generally good, and more poppets are lawful than chaotic. Some spend their time trying to uncover secrets of their creation, find others like them, or keep out of trouble; these poppets are generally neutral in alignment. Poppets aren't typically religious unless a particular faith defined their creation, such as being made from scraps of Iomedaean altar cloth or woven from reeds around a sacred Gozren pool. These poppets tend to be vocally religious, even zealous, in their faith. Poppets who find religion later in their lives often revere Brigh, Casandalee, or Nethys.\nHeading:Adventurers\nPoppets like helping others and experiencing new things; both of these motivations lead naturally into the life of an adventurer. They aren't generally driven by a lust for treasure, but they like adorning themselves with pretty accoutrement and using their finds to better the lives of others. The acolyte, entertainer, and laborer backgrounds are good choices for many poppets, as are cook, scavenger, and servant. Poppets who watched their creator work might have the artist, hermit, or tinker background to reflect what they've seen. Because poppets like to help others, they gravitate toward becoming bards or champions. Some might think that poppets' small size and general clumsiness make them poor fighters or rangers, but certain poppets embrace these classes out of a drive to display their bravery and prove the naysayers wrong. \nHeading:Names\nPoppets generally choose their own names, usually descriptive nicknames based on their materials, patterns, size, or demeanor. They tend to pick up and shed nicknames throughout their lives, and they happily adopt nicknames given to them by people they like. A poppet fashioned to look like a particular person, such as a doll sewn to resemble a deceased child, might proudly take the name of that person.\nHeading:Sample Names\nBurlap, Buttoneyes, Checker, Clockwhirr, Fivestitch, Nettle, Scramble, Stuffing, Taffeta, Tattercap\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Poppet Motives\nNearly all poppets are interested in helping others and finding more creatures like themselves, and both these motivations are excellent for adventure. Yet, a poppet might have any number of other, more personal motives. A poppet might adventure to find a cure for a terminally ill creator, carry out the dying wish of a deceased friend, or complete the life's goal of a spirit that awakened within them, even if the poppet doesn't know who that person was in life. A poppet might take up arms to rescue kidnapped friends or save endangered children. Poppets aren't often greedy, but some might adventure to adorn their simple forms with gemstone eyes, golden thread, or other flashy accoutrements.\nHeading:Poppet Settlements\nPoppets don't often meet another of their kind, much less settle down together. Poppet-only settlements simply don't exist or are so remote as to be wholly unknown. Instead, poppets are most common in large cities, surrounded by the bustle of crowds. Any place where people appreciate skilled artisans, whether in cloth or clockworks, is a good place to find simple poppets, and thus awakened poppets are more likely to be found in bigger cities like Absalom, Katapesh, and Quantium. Poppets usually have a network of allies to draw upon in their communities; for many poppets, this network includes their creator and their creator's associates, but even poppets who don't know their creator tend to make themselves useful and liked.\nHeading:Poppets in Society\nIt might seem strange to picture a poppet walking into a general store to buy rope and jerky, but such occurrences aren't uncommon in urban areas. Poppets are, after all, designed to handle mundane tasks, so people aren't likely to call attention to a poppet going about routine business in such communities. People might even help the poppet out by leaning a plank so it can reach a counter or adjusting a heavy load-thinking that, by doing so, they're aiding a powerful or influential owner. Talk is likely to circulate, however, if the poppet is active in a small settlement where such helper constructs are unknown, or if the poppet is engaged in some truly unusual tasks, like giving a speech or dragging in a slain monster for a bounty.\n",

   "Skeleton",
   "Undead"
  ],
  "description": "Skeletons are considered among the lowest types of undead. They're typically mindless creatures, lacking many of the abilities that make other undead a serious threat. However, the animated bones of dragons, giants, and other great beasts make for dangerous foes. Powerful living creatures can retain some of their might and intellect upon returning as a skeleton. Some necromancers turn their strongest enemies into skeletal undead servants, assuming they can keep control of them.\nSkeleton adventurers were usually skilled and powerful in their former lives. Through unremitting force of will or extraordinary circumstances, their ego and ideals persist even in death. However, the very act of rising as a skeletal undead is traumatic. Memories of one's former life are usually fractured or hazy, if anything can be remembered at all. For some, these memories return with time; for others, they're gone forever. For the most part, this comes down to how the skeleton views themself: either as a continuation of the person they once were, or an entirely new being.\n Skeleton adventurers often set themselves apart from other skeletons by dressing as flamboyantly as their station allows. Large, feathered caps, ornate armor, embroidered silks, or glittering jewelry are likely staples of their wardrobe. Some carve intricate \u201ctattoos\u201d into their bones or paint their skulls to maintain a sense of self that simple skeletons lack, and to signal to the living they're not like other undead.\n Skeleton adventurers must come to terms with their new identity. They aren't bound by the limitations of the living and are often underestimated.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Work harder than most to prove you're a capable and distinct individual.\n\t- Wade into danger with little regard for the safety of your undead body.\n\t- Desperately seek the acceptance of the society you once moved through with ease.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you're the servant of a necromancer, working to advance their agenda.\n\t- Have difficulty empathizing with you.\n\t- Regard your undeath with either pity or envy.\nHeading:Physical Description\nAside from their complete lack of flesh and organs, skeletons vary widely in appearance, reflecting the broad diversity of all living beings. They can be tall, short, or anywhere in between. Skeletons of creatures with horns, wings, or tails retain them, although they are usually useless in their skeletal state. Skeletons raised from fresh remains tend to have stark white bones, while older ones tend to be gray or yellowed. Skeletons who adventure for a while often possess faint lines crisscrossing their bones like scars, indicating where they were injured in previous battles.\nHeading:Society\nAcross Golarion, intelligent skeletons rarely gather in large enough numbers to constitute any kind of settlement. Even in Geb, where their numbers are highest, they typically mingle with other undead rather than band together. Many skeletons would rather keep company with those who remind them of their former life (although such reminders can just as easily lead to revulsion derived by the negative energy infused within them). Gebbite skeletons are usually treated as members of the servant class and rarely have any upward social mobility.\n Outside Geb, skeletons are far more solitary. Some might hide on the outskirts of society or move about in disguise, but it's difficult for them to find acceptance among the living. While they may not be feared in places like Nidal or Sekamina, they're also not likely to be respected.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nWhile undead are almost always evil, some intelligent skeletons manage to stave off the corruption of the negative energy that powers them. Other than the tendency to become twisted toward evil over time, skeletons typically lean toward the alignments of their creators or their former selves. Skeletons without any particular loyalty or allegiance trend toward neutral evil alignment, or neutral if they can stave off evil.\n Skeletons who embrace their undeath often worship gods of death, such as Urgathoa, while those who resent it typically look toward gods of life and redemption. Accepting deities without particularly zealous anti-undead dogma, such as Shelyn, are popular among those who wish to fight against their destructive influences and become something greater than the purpose for which they were created.\nHeading:Names\nNo widespread naming convention exists for skeletons. When necromancers bother to name skeletons they've raised, they typically choose names that suit their own tastes, the way one would name a pet. Others might be named for their role or job. Skeletons with their memories intact might choose to keep their name from when they were alive, but others might choose new names based on their undead experiences.\nHeading:Sample Names\nClatterjaw, Creaker, Doorstop, Final Sacrifice, Gochiyo, Lectern, Macefodder, Sixth Lancer, Skulldyr, Xelim\n",

  "description": "PFS Note Characters with the Reflection versatile heritage may not be a Reflection of any known and named NPC in Pathfinder canon. Your appearance may be used to strengthen your character's story and roleplay, but cannot be used to impact gameplay during Organized Play adventures.\nStories of malevolent duplicates are commonly told around campfires to frighten companions. In these tales, the duplicate forms after a botched ritual or exposure to a mysterious artifact, and is bent on replacing the creature they've replicated. Most believe such stories to be only that, but such reflection duplicates are real. While some wish to replace their progenitors, others merely want to forge a new life for themselves where no one knows of their origins.\nMethods of their creation vary, but all reflections are duplicates of someone else existing in the world. Some are drawn out from literal mirrors, developing a life of their own once set free from the Echoing Pale. Mirror-focused rituals or spells can create independent reflections, whether deliberately or accidentally, as can the magical hazard known as a darkside mirror, which replaces those looking into it with malicious duplicates. Some reflections are created as magical clones by spellcasters, only to turn on their creators or be left adrift, while others arise from polymorph magic gone wrong.\n If you want a character who seeks to forge their own identity in the face of their duplicate nature, with a strong tie to another character somewhere out there in the world, you should play a reflection.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Feel as though you're just an out-of-place imitation.\n\t- Want to keep your nature a secret from everyone except trusted companions.\n\t- Be extremely dedicated to your friends or anyone who gives you a sense of community.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Don't realize your true nature as a copy.\n\t- Expect you to be plotting a nefarious fate for your progenitor.\n\t- Are wary of or intrigued by your unusual abilities.\nHeading:Physical Description\nA reflection's physical appearance almost exactly matches their progenitor's. In mirror-risen reflections, their appearance is reversed, so details such as scars are on the opposite side. Other reflections often have a swirled mark somewhere on their bodies, appearing as a tattoo or birthmark. Reflections are typically indistinguishable from a regular member of that ancestry.\nHeading:Society\nAs duplicates of others, and ones that appear only in rare circumstances, reflections have no inherent society of their own. Many reflections have a degree of existential angst, struggling to find somewhere they feel they belong and won't be identified as a \u201cfake.\u201d A reflection's greatest (though not necessarily best) bond is usually to their progenitor. Progenitors and their reflections are sometimes aware of each other, with some progenitors taking their reflection under their wing, which often grants the reflection a greater sense of community.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nDespite the tales, not all reflections are malevolent. Reflections formed from darkside mirrors are always evil, but others usually have either the alignment of their progenitor or the exact opposite one-many good-aligned reflections arise from the nefarious experiments of an evil alchemist or spellcaster. Most reflections are wary of religion, but those who adhere to a faith are typically extremely devout.\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Final Usurpation\nIf your progenitor is deceased, you might be able to take over their life. It might require a special ritual and other activities taking 1 week, as you take over your progenitor's lodgings, activities, relationships, and so on. Once you finish, provided no creature has successfully identified you as an impostor, the memories of everyone who knew or interacted with your progenitor are altered, so they forget your progenitor's usual personality and behavior in favor of yours, and you no longer risk discovery for acting out of character for them. You belong now.\nSee Versatile heritages.\n"

 "Ghoran": {
  "source": "Impossible Lands pg. 35",
  "trait": [
   "Ghoran",
   "Humanoid",
   "Plant"
  ],
  "description": "These intelligent plant people, created by a long-dead druid, possess a sort of immortality through their seeds-unless these are destroyed by external events other than merely the ravages of time.\nDuring the height of the wars between Geb and Nex long ago, the archmage Nex asked the renegade druid Ghorus to create a plant that would feed his people even in the most inhospitable land. Ghorus did so, developing a flower that would adapt to every environment and withstand every sort of magecraft and spellworking. He succeeded too well. In the strange soil of the Impossible Lands, the flower grew and soon began to think-and then to walk and speak. These were the first ghorans. Despite their new awareness, ghorans found that many other peoples were adept at ignoring inconvenient truths, especially those involving where their next meal might come from. Bit by bit, seed by seed, ghorans grew themselves into humanoid forms, hoping to engender sympathy by mirroring the appearance of humanoids. It eventually worked, and the ghorans won citizenship and protected status in the nation of Nex. Even so, time and predation has taken its toll; the population of ghorans is small and ever dwindling.\n Each ghoran is essentially an ancient spark of life that inhabits, successively, a series of plantlike bodies. Every twenty years or so, a ghoran produces a seed. Their old body withers away as their soul enters the seed, which then swiftly produces a new body. The process brings with it minor changes in personality and some loss of more distant memories, such that each new ghoran is related to their predecessor while still being a different individual. The art of creating more ghorans died with the druid Ghorus, so they're a tiny but stable minority in the Impossible Lands, dwindling bit by bit over the centuries as a few of them fall to violence and mischance.\n If you want a character who's an ancient and alien soul, trying to survive and thrive in a strange and hostile world, you should play a ghoran.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Offhandedly mention events from thousands of years ago.\n\t- Find \u201canimal\u201d behaviors strange.\n\t- Constantly make small changes to your body.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Have a hard time recognizing you after not seeing you for a while.\n\t- Are either intimidated or fascinated by how long you've lived and how much you know.\n\t- Have heard you're delicious.\nHeading:Physical Description\nRoughly humanoid in size and shape, a ghoran's body is mostly made up of a fibrous plant material resembling a woody vine, with a face like an enormous, colorful flower. Ghorans have a great deal of control over the shape and structure of their bodies: with a few hours of effort, a ghoran might make themselves taller or shorter, long-limbed or barrel-chested. They have a reputation for tasting deliciously sweet and herbaceous. Most people merely find this quality a curiosity and don't attempt to take a bite, but animals in the wild will sometimes seek them out and attack them. Though they can learn to smile or laugh to fit in with other ancestries, they tend to use a different set of emotional signifiers, fluttering their face-petals to show happiness and making a rustling sound when agitated or upset.\n Every ghoran has a large cavity within their torso that contains a large seed. When a ghoran's body becomes too decrepit to function, they impart their memories into the seed and plant it into the ground. Within 1 to 2 months, a new ghoran body finishes growing from the seed, and the original ghoran collapses into a pile of inert organic matter. This curious method of propagation leaves a ghoran vulnerable, and many ghorans are defensive about the process among non-ghoran peoples.\n Being plants, ghorans have no innate understanding of gender in the human sense. Ghorans who find themselves in the company of other ancestries sometimes adopt a more masculine or feminine form, though just as many don't bother.\nHeading:Society\nGhorans originated in Nex, and most reside as a tiny minority population in that land. In its major cities, they have built little enclaves of their own in neighborhoods featuring sweeping parks and massive trees, with the largest of these enclaves being in Quantium. While they don't possess the magical ability to enter an extradimensional home within a tree like dryads, ghorans live among the trees, typically making their homes within the neighborhoods' big parks. They are extremely skilled at building their abodes so that they don't disrupt the lives of the local flora. Visitors to a ghoran enclave might not realize initially that they've entered a home, assuming instead that they're in a recreational public space. Ghorans don't typically mind the unexpected company so long as the visitors are respectful of the park, of their homes, and of any ghorans they meet. The ghorans who live in major cities are relatively social and accepting of other ancestries, and they tend to be eager to interact, learn about others, and engage in trade.\n Outside of these cities, ghorans inhabit small, remote communities in the foothills of the Shattered Range and dwell in secluded forests, and they tend to be much more isolationist. Remembering well that Ghorus originally created their ancestry as food for the \u201canimals,\u201d they generally have no great desire to get to know other ancestries. However, as each new incarnation slightly shifts a ghoran's personality, they sometimes develop a wanderlust that spurs them to leave an isolated home and travel into the wider world. Often, such ghorans hold bits-or even troves-of ancient lore lost to the outside world for many years, so their journeys can sometimes lead to important new discoveries for others in the Impossible Lands and beyond.\n Among themselves, ghorans cooperate easily and instinctively, with no need for a formal government. Work is apportioned by a silent consensus derived from thousands of years of experience, as everyone does what they're best at to cover necessary tasks. This silent consensus is already practiced at determining how to adjust and adapt when one ghoran falls ill or changes in a new incarnation. The addition of new ghorans traveling from afar or of members of other ancestries can sometimes throw off this natural rhythm. The new addition is an unknown quantity, so the entire community keeps tabs on the newcomers, to a potentially unsettling extent, for a short period of analysis. This practice isn't out of any distrust or desire for harm, but rather out of curiosity and a need to understand what the newcomers do well and where they need assistance. Once the ghoran community has drawn a conclusion, they adjust their actions accordingly-everyone simply begins to perform tasks differently to allow newcomers to fit in and contribute, with no official meeting or declaration. In most cases, one of the members of the community realizes they should tell non-ghoran newcomers what the community expects of them, but sometimes no one realizes there's a need to communicate. When this happens, it can leave the ghoran community and the newcomers perplexed at the others' actions and choices, as the community expects the newcomers to simply pitch in and fill the need while the newcomers wait to be told what the community expects of them.\n Ghoran communities, operating on this ancient consensus, generally don't have anything resembling leaders. Nonetheless, a community will sometimes appoint a single ghoran as an envoy to outsiders and even give them a title to make the \u201canimals\u201d more comfortable when receiving a message from the whole community.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nGhorans typically lack driving forces toward good or evil, though their plant-derived values can sometimes make them come across as amoral to people who are not likewise plant based. They have a slight tendency toward law, especially in their own communities.\n While most ghorans aren't particularly religious, spiritually oriented ones tend to worship nature by means of the Green Faith or, less commonly, Gozreh or one of the Eldest (such as the plantlike Green Mother). They rarely find interest in human-centric deities, as ghorans have distinctly different thought processes and priorities. Faith is a matter that usually doesn't change much from seed to seed and incarnation to incarnation, and that means that the newer deities, especially those ascended in the last few millennia (\u201crecently,\u201d from the ghoran perspective) have almost no foothold in ghoran communities.\nHeading:Adventurers\nBorn of magic and hailing from a magical land, acolytes (of the Green Faith, typically) and fortune-tellers are both common backgrounds for adventuring ghorans. Rural- or forest-dwelling ghorans might be farmhands, herbalists, or hermits, while those who reside in Nex's great cities might be artisans, artists, or scholars. \n While many ghorans learn a bit of magic, some become wizards or druids. Others are sorcerers with an elemental bloodline dating back to the moment of creation or an imperial bloodline recalling a particularly masterful past life. More martial ghorans become fighters or rangers, and some careful and methodical living plants make excellent alchemists and investigators.\nHeading:Names\nMost ghorans pick a new name with each incarnation, usually selecting a name or concept that they found pleasing in a past life. Occasionally, a ghoran might reuse a name for several incarnations in a row, especially if remaining in a community of other peoples, though each incarnation is still a distinct person.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAmsalu, Ash, Emnet, Sieri, Ooniel, Arshmarish, Velt, Delphinium, Hach, Emerald, Sable\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Ghoran Enclaves\nGhorans were created in Nex, and the bulk of their population still resides there. The single largest ghoran population in the world is in Quantium, where ghorans have an entire park-neighborhood, flanked by ancient trees planted thousands of years ago, to call their own. Other ghorans live in remote villages in the foothills of the Shattered Range, as far away from outsiders as they can contrive.\nHeading:Ghoran Travelers\nOutside of Nex, ghorans rarely have the numbers to form their own communities, though other major cities in Golarion with trade routes to Nex might have as many as a half-dozen living plants dwelling in them. Ghorans prefer to seek out others of their own kind, or failing that, find local druids or other defenders of nature who could give a ghoran support during their unusual life cycle.\n",

Their inherent psychic abilities make them natural empaths but also occasionally burden them with the unceasing thoughts of their neighbors.\nKashrishi occupy a unique evolutionary branch native to the lands bordering the northern stretches of the Obari Ocean. Resembling halfling-sized bipedal rhinoceroses with the occasional odd insectile feature, kashrishi adapt to their environs with unusual efficiency, using a combination of rapid physical evolutions and inherent psychic powers. Kashrishi are often mistakenly referred to as having hive minds, though they're actually natural empaths, capable of discerning a creature's emotional state and impulses through proximity. This near-oracular behavior occasionally leads to misunderstandings with humanoids who think a kashrishi is reading their thoughts or otherwise magically influencing the conversation, though peoples more familiar with kashrishi come to value their unique insights and intuitive diplomacy.\n Kashrishi have an atypical level of control over their physical forms, thanks to their psychic powers, and can evolve new features over the course of a single generation. Typically, these features are intentionally cultivated to help deal with a particular environmental obstacle, such as a change in weather patterns, or if an invasive species affects available food supplies near their settlements.\n Kashrishi often tailor their evolutions to match the most successful creatures in their environment. Whether a testament to the resilience of insects or simply a quirk of their environment, many kashrishi evolutions are directly inspired by creatures like the rhinoceros beetle or giant water bug.\n If you want a character that's visually distinct, able to naturally access the occult powers of the mind, and great at quickly making friends wherever they go, you should play a kashrishi.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Be easily taken aback by people who are particularly loud, expressive, or emotional.\n\t- Prefer the peaceful quiet of remote islands, treetops, and caverns.\n\t- Act as a parental figure for the more excitable among your companions.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Underestimate your strength and resilience.\n\t- Mistake you for being unsociable when you're actually taking time to process mental and physical cues of which they're completely unaware.\n\t- Value you for your patience and insights.\nHeading:Physical Description\nKashrishi have short but wide frames with remarkable strength for their size.

The most common kashrishi, xyloshis, have a large primary horn and between one and three smaller horns, typically arranged linearly from the tip of their nose and spanning along their nose and brow.\n While most kashrishi have light sandy or gray skin tones, their coloration can also echo the tones of their crystalline horns; sapphire, ruby, or emerald patterns aren't so uncommon as to cause another kashrishi to take notice. Kashrishi with strong connections to specific creatures with whom they share their home environments might take on skin patterns or colorations that mirror those creatures. Some stories even talk about kashrishi with wings and butterfly patterns that cover their bodies, though no such kashrishi has been seen in the Impossible Lands for at least a century.\nHeading:Society\nDespite their small stature, kashrishi tend to be terrible at hiding. Their crystalline horns are likely to flare with magical light when they exercise their innate magical powers, and they're raised in an environment where their parents or guardians can almost always find them by feeling for their emotions. As a result, kashrishi tend to be excessively honest and kind, avoiding harmful deceptions but also employing enough tact to ensure they don't evoke unpleasant emotional reactions from others.\n Kashrishi lack a clear concept of charity, not because they're cruel or inconsiderate, but rather because their worldview is inherently inclusive of the people around them. Rare indeed is the kashrishi who exercises casual cruelty or who leaves another member of the community in need. Such actions lead to emotional reactions that cause turmoil for all kashrishi in the vicinity.\n Kashrishi enjoy various team games, employing games of trivia as measures of both knowledge and psychic ability. They also appreciate games that involve bluffs and double-bluffs with blind cards, testing their abilities to keep their minds clear and their thoughts organized. Kashrishi don't generally condone the act of gambling with outsiders, as many find it challenging to deal with the implications of their psychic abilities, even if they strive to keep their powers secret.\n Kashrishi generally engage in monogamous relationships with no real preference toward any particular gender pairing. The height of intimacy for a kashrishi is opening their mind fully to the psychic link of another kashrishi, an act much more personal than anything physical. This act doesn't let kashrishi know whether someone is perfectly compatible with them or that the two mesh entirely-simply that from moment to moment, their inner feelings are more accessible and open, so communication becomes not a guessing game but an entirely wholesome, true experience. Some kashrishi believe that psychic communication should be held exclusively for these intimate moments.\n Kashrishi can be found in small groups on the island of Jalmeray and in larger communities occupying the many smaller islands surrounding it. Kashrishi in the Inner Sea region rarely venture beyond the Impossible Lands, though some of their oldest stories speak of a harrowing voyage across the Obari Ocean when their kind fled some long-past disaster.\n Kashrishi have no natural enemies. They host pirates and merchants with equal hospitality, so long as that hospitality is respected by their guests. While kashrishi are exceptionally tolerant of the quirks and foibles of other species, they draw a hard line at anyone bringing outside conflicts into their communities. More than one canny pirate captain docks their ship at a kashrishi island after a particularly heated conflict, knowing the pirate hunters and military vessels seeking them won't encroach on kashrishi lands. Escaped criminals hoping to find a new lease on life might also hide in a kashrishi community, doing whatever they can to assist their hosts until whoever is hunting them gives up the chase.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nMost kashrishi are good, and almost instinctively kind because of their empathic abilities and tight-knit communities. Kashrishi are rarely interested in religion, though a few deities are more likely to be worshipped by kashrishi than others. Desna is known to kashrishi as \u201cThe Crystal Butterfly,\u201d and when a kashrishi child goes missing, their parents might pray the Crystal Butterfly uses the light of her wings to guide the child home. Besmara is also unusually likely to be worshipped by kashrishi, though her dogma among them is essentially a splinter faith that focuses on her primacy over sea monsters and storms with little regard to the piratical teachings for which most other ancestries know the goddess.\nHeading:Adventurers\nMost kashrishi never become adventurers, content in their remote homes. Those kashrishi who do become adventurers often do so from necessity after being conscripted by pirates or washed away to distant locales by tropical storms. Occasionally, more adventurous lethoci and trogloshi kashrishi intentionally leave their islands to either found new colonies or to seek adventure. Any kashrishi might also take on the adventuring lifestyle in response to overcrowding on their home island.\n Kashrishi rely on their inherent occult powers to ward off monsters, and they use their inherent empathic abilities to form bonds with allies. Kashrishi make natural bards, champions, and psychics. Typical kashrishi backgrounds include the artist, emissary, fortune teller, and herbalist backgrounds.\nHeading:Names\nThe empathic sense of a kashrishi has its own \u201cmental fingerprint\u201d that's unique to each member of the species, and this mental fingerprint can be conveyed through psychic communications as a name. Kashrishi who adventure with non-kashrishi often adopt descriptive names that their companions can more easily speak and remember.\nHeading:Sample Names\nClimber, Firehorn, Guardian, Healer, Lantern, Mother, Scout, Softhand, Tempest, Warrior\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Kashrishi and Religion\nKashrishi can worship any god, and they often lean toward deities most commonly worshipped in Jalmeray, but most kashrishi don't feel the need for religion. Kashrishi communities are so deeply connected through their empathic and psychic links that religion is often considered superfluous. Religion tends to have specific benefits in a community: care for the poor, unifying and teaching community morals, providing gathering spaces, and such. Almost all of these functions come inherently to kashrishi, thanks to the hive-like nature of their empathic communication.\nHeading:Kashrishi Guests\nKashrishi communities welcome visitors and happily host all kinds of guests. Despite their welcoming nature, kashrishi settlements are often relieved when visits from larger groups, such as merchant ships and other trading vessels, end. Most humanoids take few precautions to conceal their thoughts and emotions, so a kashrishi might hardly distinguish even the politest ship crew from a barge full of rowdy pirates.\nHeading:Thoughts on Kashrishi\nMost people on Golarion beyond the island of Jalmeray aren't aware kashrishi exist. Jalmeri humans might trade with kashrishi, and they might hire athamasi scouts to staff the crow's nests of their ships or xyloshi warriors to serve as guards; however, people beyond Jalmeray's borders and shipping lanes are likely to mistake a kashrishi as a magical experiment or even an extraplanar visitor. While such misunderstandings can make kashrishi targets for ignorant villagers afraid of the unknown, the halfling-sized rhinos usually have the diplomatic skills to safely extricate themselves before situations turn violent.\n",

 "Nagaji": {

  "trait": [
   "Humanoid",
   "Nagaji"
  ],
  "description": "With humanoid figures and serpentine heads, nagaji are heralds, companions, and servitors of powerful nagas. They hold a deep reverence for holy areas and spiritual truths, an aspect many others find as intimidating as a nagaji's appearance.\nNagaji are creations of the goddess Nalinivati, who was inspired by both humans and nagas. This inspiration, alongside nagaji's devotion to nagas, has led many to claim nagaji were created to be servants. However, Nalinivati created nagaji simply for the sake of creating. She envisioned a world where nagas and nagaji worked together to succeed, with nagas serving as sacred guardians, and nagaji living as mortals upon Golarion, respecting nagas for their strength and wisdom. Nagaji live up to this expectation, forming nations, temples, and villages with as many varied governments, societies, and traditions as there are scales on a serpent's back. If nagaji can be said to share any trait, it's devotion, be it to a community, a temple, a concept, or a lifestyle. Most nagaji are also drawn to the spiritual in all its expressions, even the darker aspects of philosophies and religions.\n If you want a character who combines the crushing strength and the sinuous mystery of a serpent, you should play a nagaji.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Enjoy the intersection of spirituality and everyday life.\n\t- Have deep reserves of patience for tasks others might find boring.\n\t- Adhere to strong beliefs and traditions about your place in the universe.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you have no goals or interests beyond serving nagas.\n\t- Find your unblinking eyes and serpentine features intimidating.\n\t- Are awed by your connection and dedication to holy natural places.\nHeading:Physical Description\nNagaji are prone to sharp differences in appearance. Some have tails alongside legs, some have sharp claws on their hands and feet, and some are so unique from their kin that they're mistaken for lamias rather than nagaji. The most common nagaji features are a serpentine head and a humanoid body. They usually have the unblinking eyes of a snake, though other peoples often claim a nagaji's gaze is far more intense. Scales cover nagaji bodies, with patterns that resemble those of snakes or nagas. Depending on their heritage, a nagaji's neck might be as long as a swan's or as short as a human's, and many have a frill of skin or scales down their back. Nagaji tend to possess crushing strength, but how it manifests can vary; some have bulky figures, while others have the slender yet powerful musculature of a snake.\nHeading:Society\nNagaji communities widely vary, from ancient empires to tiny fishing villages. They tend to be isolated from other peoples, more as a matter of convenience than choice; nagaji have different physical needs than most ancestries, so even when integrated into mixed communities, they tend to live with other nagaji. Everything from marriage traditions, religion, social roles, valued arts, and methods of governance differs in specific nagaji communities. Within these communities, however, nagaji often have very strict and traditional views on these topics. Multiple instances of wars between nagaji have come about due to one group of nagaji finding another's practices unacceptable. This perspective applies to relations with other peoples as well. For instance, most nagaji consider themselves rivals and enemies of garudas due to their historical legends, even if the nagaji involved have never even seen a garuda.\n Nagaji originated in the Tian Xia region of Nagajor. Though they have since spread across Golarion to regions such as Vudra and Jalmeray, many of them still carry traditions from their ancestral homeland. Tian and Vudrani concepts of elements, medicine, and spirituality are highly common among nagaji, especially given their tendency of seeing themselves as highly pious beings. Nagaji mostly eschew the human concept of castes, beyond the vague view of a \u201cnatural order\u201d that sees nagas as holy guides to mortal nagaji, but they can see the appeal of the concept of karma and the righteousness of fulfilling their proper role in the universe. While they have little physical need for clothes, as they stick to hot and humid environments, nagaji wear them with pride and treat them as decorative elements in the same manner as jewelry.\n As nagas are usually matriarchal, nagaji have a strong respect for women in leadership positions. Not all nagaji follow suit with matriarchal societies, but they tend to trace lineage through the mother, and almost no nagaji societies are strictly patriarchal.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nNagaji are most commonly neutral but otherwise don't have any strong pull toward specific alignments. The presence of a naga can sway nagaji toward that naga's ethos, but a nagaji's view on life tends to be determined by the culture to which they belong.\n Nagaji overwhelmingly worship Nalinivati, their creator, to the point that any nagaji who pay homage to a different god over Nalinivati provoke strong negative reactions from their kin. While nagaji believe reverence for Ravithra, the supposed mother of nagas, to be proper and accept it more readily than other faiths, most believe Ravithra shouldn't be troubled with the requests of mortal adherents. A very small minority of nagaji in Jalmeray are drawn to the worship of the war god Diomazul; these adherents are tolerated by other nagaji, but seen as just as terrifying and dangerous as their patron god and usually avoided.\nHeading:Adventurers\nAs the backbone of naga-ruled societies, nagaji can have any background imaginable, reflecting their intended role in society. Outside naga realms, nagaji adventurers often have the acolyte, emissary, guard, or merchant backgrounds. A nagaji's strength means they excel as fighters and champions, but they're flexible enough that they can do well in any role they put their mind to, and clerics, sorcerers, and alchemists are popular professions. \n The most common reason for nagaji to adventure is at the behest of a naga superior or for the benefit of a nagaji community, but their reasons can be as varied as any other people on Golarion. Nagaji might set out seeking holy sites in the world, searching for enlightenment, looking for material treasures, or for personal reasons related to their background, family, or city\nHeading:Names\nNagaji names vary depending on what region of the world they occupy, but they tend to possess short vowels when they have any at all. Nagaji usually name themselves or allow groups of siblings to name each other as children, a tradition that often sees nagaji eagerly shedding these names for new ones when they reach adulthood.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAdesha, Garija, Kaya, Kuwana, Onok, Paravata, Sheni, Takasha, Tasi, Ulu, Vaski, Yulbin\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Nagaji Enclaves\nThe original nagaji home is Nagajor, a hot and jungle-covered land in the south of Tian Xia. Here, polities of naga rulers and nagaji citizens dominate the area, each unique in its own right; a left turn might bring a traveler to an overbearing tyranny, while a right turn might take one to an idyllic paradise. Wherever nagas can be found, however, nagaji are quick to follow. Nagaji settlements are also found in Vudra, central and southern Tian Xia, and Jalmeray, with a few slipping into Garund and Casmaron\nHeading:Nagaji Travelers\nNagaji are very rarely found outside hot and humid climates. Their ophidian natures leave them sluggish in cold weather, and they require a certain amount of moisture to shed easily- excessive dryness can result in dead skin unpleasantly sticking to their scales. Areas that are unfamiliar with nagaji are also likely to mistake them for serpentfolk, a tragic misunderstanding that halts nagaji communities from spreading further.\n",

 "Vanara": {

  "trait": [
   "Humanoid",
   "Vanara"
  ],
  "description": "Vanaras are inquisitive and mischievous monkey-like humanoids with short, soft fur, expressive eyes, and long, prehensile tails. Their handlike feet and agile builds serve them well in the jungle realms where most vanaras live.\nVanaras were born of the monkey god Ragdya's ambitious folly ages ago, to spread and applaud his mischief and to serve as ba-sadhak, blessed seekers of fortune who would draw their creator's eye to the cruelly hoarded treasure of mortal lords and immortal fiends. They earned the enmity of ancient rakshasa maharajahs for their derring-do, the scorn of the naga empire for their valor, and the friendship of many rural Vudrani who viewed them as a wild folk of deep divine portent. Such is the history of vanaras and their long survival against their many foes, from within the mahajanapadas of the deep jungle lands, the mountain ghats of Vudra, and the Impossible Lands.\n If you want to play a character who embodies the struggle between self-betterment and self-expression, you should play a vanara.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Find it difficult to avoid pursuing a mystery or exploring a hidden area.\n\t- Thoughtfully consider the consequences of your pranks or actions.\n\t- Enjoy sharing the knowledge of things you've discovered with your friends.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Assume you have an animalistic demeanor and habits.\n\t- Take a dismissive or hostile view of your pranks.\n\t- Covet your easy grace and unquenchable curiosity.\nHeading:Physical Description\nVanaras are humanoids with simian features, including a long, prehensile tail and handlike feet. They're rarely much taller than 5 feet, but they usually look smaller because of their slight, nimble builds. Vanaras are covered with a thin layer of soft fur over their entire bodies. This fur can be tan, brown, or golden and rarely has spots or stripes. The hair on a vanara's head grows thicker and more luxurious; it's easy to arrange into elaborate hairstyles, and many vanaras like to do so. This hair is nearly always of the same color as the vanara's body fur, with the exception of rare \u201cwhitecape\u201d vanaras with manes of fine, pale hair, who might be born into any vanara family. Vanaras have large, expressive eyes and mouths with blunt teeth and pointed incisors. Vanaras are adults at 13 years old and usually live about 60 years.\nHeading:Society\nVanaras are a varied folk who seek balance and comfort in their lives. Many are devout without being fanatics, tricksters without being malicious, daring without being foolish, and curious without being obsessive. Although aware of their deep ancestral connection to Ragdya, many vanaras feel a powerful desire to live beyond the grace of their god and his weight in their history, pursuing their own paths to enlightenment. Those vanaras who live in Vudra feel this need the most strongly, as they want to pursue virtue and self-knowledge to be fulfilled when their souls are next reborn into the world.\n Although created by Ragdya, vanaras feel themselves apart from him in a way some find uncomfortable. Ragdya is the eternal trickster with supreme recklessness yet unchanging in his immortal permanence. Though most vanaras cherish Ragdya's mischief and feats of folly on religious holidays, they also know he shall never fade from this world or find himself reincarnated into forms other than that from which the vanaras were shaped. Yet, vanaras aren't so immutable. A vanara must reflect on their own impermanent nature and consider its effect on their soul and their soul's quest for enlightenment. For all the mischief and daring Ragdya might enjoy without consequence, vanaras know recklessness and harmful tricks can impede their personal pursuit of enlightenment. The drive toward mischief and spontaneity instilled within them by their creator is hard for many vanaras to overcome and can create a lifetime of internal turmoil. This source of conflict has colored their development as a people who seek balance and virtue.\n Vanaras look to the legends of heroic vanaras of the past for lessons on how to live their lives. The most notable and lauded accomplishment of these legendary vanaras, that which has them known even in the most far-flung ashram in the snow-capped border mountains of Vudra, was their grand act of trickery against Ravana, the greatest of all the rakshasa immortals. Ravana had tyrannically forced many noble souls, vanara and human alike, to construct a resplendent bridge of azure stones that would cross the planes from Vudra to the rakshasa's realm. Ravana demanded that each stone be carved to display a mewling visage of the mortal who toiled to cut and shape it. Through mischief and artifice, vanaras altered the carvings so that, when assembled, they subtly displayed components of a prayer to all the Vudrani pantheon. When the bridge was finally finished and Ravana marched across it with his army of fiends in a profligate parade, the shuddering of the stones beneath their footsteps mimicked the movements of the communal prayer. Deities drawn by this display toppled the immortal maharajah, and he still blames mischief-making vanaras for this humiliation. Many vanaras thus see it as their legacy to bring shame to the wicked and powerful by means of clever tricks and communal effort.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nVanaras are tricksters who love pranks, but they temper this tendency toward mischief with good intentions and a love of their community-however they personally define that community. They're rarely agitators or troublemakers simply for the sake of causing chaos; they do so to encourage humility among the inflexible or humorless. Most vanaras are mindful of the virtues necessary to elevate their immortal souls and try to act accordingly. Vanaras are thus most likely to be neutral good.\n Most vanaras live in Vudra, where they're exposed to the dizzyingly abundant array of Vudran deities. Nevertheless, devout vanaras nearly always venerate Ragdya above all others. Priests of Ragdya lead most vanara villages. Even vanaras who aren't religious might call upon Ragdya to help them make wise decisions in times of danger or for guidance when an unlucky prank has caused them trouble they're unsure how to escape. Vanaras interested in developing self-control might worship Irori instead, and regions with local vanara hero-gods or avatars might engender faithful sects of worshippers on a small scale. Some vanaras revere the evil simian hunter Lahkgya, but almost never openly, as this deity of ferocious and sudden violence is unwelcome in most vanara communities. Some communities instead make offerings to turn Lahkgya's attention from them.\nHeading:Adventurers\nVanara society, and its complex relationship with Ragdya, produces many adventurers who journey in search of greater insight into their nature of being and into other means that might provide them peace and enlightenment. Nearly all children are raised on the many embellished tales of their ancestors, vanara folk heroes, and their progenitor deity, and they emulate those stories as soon as they can. Thus, many vanaras have a background that evokes a colorful life prior to adventuring, such as criminal, entertainer, gambler, sailor, or scout.\n Vanaras found afield are often champions, rangers, or rogues, but vanaras of every class view themselves as aligning with their beliefs, often with a special focus on their relationship with Ragdya and other gods. Vanaras who rely upon magic often find themselves serving as witches under the patronage of distant karmic entities or ancient spiritual allies to the gods, or oracles with unusual curses and mysteries.\nHeading:Names\nNewborn vanaras aren't given names other than descriptors of their infant personalities or habits, like \u201cGrip-Hand\u201d or \u201cWailer.\u201d When they learn to speak, vanaras are given another name based on important historical or mythological figures, or they're given the name of a specific ancestor they resemble in appearance or attitude (or whom their community hopes they'll grow to resemble). The chosen name usually contains consonants or vowels the young vanara frequently uses, as vanaras don't see a lot of use in giving someone a name they can't easily pronounce.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAshpaka, Chichipi, Haangeno, Hasa, Huanu, Kana, Nammem, Roprutu, Thathona, Unulu, Vivatu\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Natural Explorers\nVanaras might be found anywhere throughout the Impossible Lands. Those who seek discipline and greater insight into the arcane mysteries of existence have been known to gather within Nex's city of Quantium, where they trade knowledge of fiends and ancient koans as easily as others trade coins. Vanaras are a known, albeit quite unusual, sight within the metropolis of Absalom. From there, a vanara's journey to find enlightenment and self-knowledge-or to escape the relentless cycles of their past-might take them anywhere in the world.\nHeading:Vanara Enclaves\nOutside Vudra, where their numbers are plentiful and their presence relatively high, vanaras are typically seen only in the city of Niswan in Jalmeray, where they dwell as any other citizen under the thakur's influence.

  "description": "Vishkanyas are ophidian humanoids who carry potent venom within their blood and saliva. Largely misunderstood due to old tales of their toxicity and natural finesse, vishkanyas work to grow into more than just what stories paint them to be.\nThe true nature of vishkanyas' origin is a matter of debate. Some vishkanyas believe they are rejected spawn of Ravithra, which explains the animosity between vishkanyas and nagas. Others believe themselves the stolen offspring of a forgotten progenitor whose name was excised from history. Regardless, one thing is quite clear: vishkanyas are survivors. Throughout history, fear of their deadly abilities forced vishkanyas to experience subjugation, exploitation, and ostracizing. Yet through it all, they endured. Now free of chains to bind them, vishkanyas live in close-knit groups, and use their love of storytelling and the arts to keep a detailed history of their people while they determine how best to proceed in a world ripe with opportunity.\nHeading:You Might...\n\t- Have a powerful sense of community.\n\t- Find peace and fulfillment in having a creative pursuit.\n\t- Be adept at matching the environment around you to fit into any number of diverse situations.\nHeading:Others Probably...\n\t- Initially mistake you for having a tiefling or draconic heritage.\n\t- Think you are an expert in poisons, toxins, and espionage.\n\t- Misunderstand the nature of your venom and fear physical contact.\nHeading:Physical Description\nVishkanyas are humanlike in appearance with ophidian features that become clear in close proximity. They are naturally tall and lithe with bright golden eyes, vertical pupils, and a forked tongue. Their small, smooth scales range from earthy tones of browns and greens to bright displays of colored patterns. Hair color is typically of darker shades, though there are occasional instances of brighter colors through parts of the hair. Vishkanyan women are usually taller than the men, though neither ever truly stops growing. As such, vishkanyas can reach heights of 7 feet or taller in old age.\n Mixed vishkanya families aren't unknown. Vishkanya offspring from this background sometimes strongly resemble their non-vishkanya parent, with only a few stray tells, such as sharp canine teeth, to indicate their heritage. Vishkanyas sometimes refer to these children as \u201cscaleless\u201d or \u201csubtle\u201d but otherwise welcome them as any other among their kin, though sadly their appearance can fuel paranoia among other ancestries toward a people who are already misunderstood.\nHeading:Society\nVishkanyas live in small, tight-knit communities between 50 and 100 individuals who assimilate discreetly into larger societies, with many such groups scattered within a larger area. At the head of these groups is a selection of women chosen for their wisdom and knowledge. Vishkanyas often have multiple partners, give birth in multiples, and adhere to maternal inheritances. Children are generally free to choose their occupation and the nature of their contribution to the larger community, with many vishkanyas pursuing some sort of craft or art. Some roles are burdened with the responsibility of cultural and historical record-keeping, however, and these important tasks continue across generations. Traditionally, these culturally minded vishkanyas regularly meet in secret congregations for the purpose of sharing stories, information, and resources, providing support for youth and creating advisory bodies to help make large-scale decisions for vishkanyas of a given area. The desire to preserve vishkanyan culture has kept this practice going for centuries, yet recently, some have called for more open interaction with the world in an attempt to proudly share vishkanyan culture.\n Vishkanyas are often mischaracterized as indiscriminately venomous or inherently malicious by other ancestries, which has led to them having very strong concepts of their own ethnicity and their separation from those they consider \u201coutsiders.\u201d While most vishkanyas are gracious and hospitable to non-vishkanya visitors, a large stir often arises around the concept of allowing such people into their communities in a more involved capacity. Parents carefully watch any children who seem too attached to non-vishkanya friends, and talk of romance and marriage with another ancestry will inevitably provoke many a long family discussion-though not necessarily hostile ones.\nHeading:Alignment and Religion\nConcerned mainly with the preservation of their communities, vishkanyas tend to adopt neutral alignments. Vishkanyas who take to individualistic travel to teach others about their ancestry, or simply to experience the world, might be neutral or chaotic good. The topic of faith can be quite different among vishkanyan groups, with some sticking to old vishkanyan beliefs, and some to Vudrani deities like Likha or Ashukharma. Other groups outside Vudra might embrace local gods with tenets of freedom or the arts, such as Arazni, Cayden Cailean, or Shelyn, or divinities more specific to individual pursuits.\nHeading:Adventurers\nVishkanyan backgrounds commonly reflect the individual's or their family's role in the community, which can include artist, hunter, acolyte, or emissary. Those who leave to explore the world outside might be entertainers, gamblers, or guards. Their natural grace and agility make vishkanyas excellent rogues, monks, or rangers, although bards, swashbucklers, and alchemists are not unusual to see.\n Vishkanyas may answer the call of adventure for many reasons: providing income for their community, developing self-expression and fulfillment, spreading knowledge and understanding of vishkanyas, accumulating stories of other peoples, or simply experiencing the world outside their family.\nHeading:Names\nVishkanyan names often include short vowel sounds in the middle of the name, with a large number of fricative consonants pronounced most accurately with a forked tongue. Names are often chosen from momentous events in vishkanyan history or from matters related to the maternal line of the child. When they go through significant life events, vishkanyas may choose new names for themselves, and many often do so multiple times. Each name represents an important part of the individual's story-who they were, and who they have become.\nHeading:Sample Names\nAshath, Casuthis of Guiding Hands, Enysi, Izith, Othasee, Riddle of Esaviz, Salthazar, Thasi the Ragebreaker\nHeading:Other Information\nHeading:Vishkanya Enclaves\nVishkanya homes can be found wherever a community decides to settle, usually in or around other major settlements. Some reclusive groups can be found in the jungles or wetlands of Vudra. Those who traveled to Jalmeray typically make their homes in Niswan, as the Niswan community has slowly become more open. Other vishkanyas decided instead to settle in the forests or coasts of the island to create their own ideal communities.\nHeading:Vishkanya Travelers\nOutside Jalmeray, vishkanyas are rare. A small number found their way into the Mwangi Expanse, the Shackles, and even Absalom. Only a handful are known to have gone past that, as intercommunity communication covers only so much. Even so, vishkanyas might find their way anywhere that has need of a skilled blade or a talented artist.\n",
